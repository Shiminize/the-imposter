# Wording Proofreader Skill

This skill is designed to proofread and rewrite narrative text to eliminate "AI-sounding" artifacts and infuse the prose with the psychological depth, atmospheric density, and authentic voice characteristic of Tana French.

## 1. Detection Goals
You must actively scan the text for the following "AI-isms" and low-quality writing markers:

*   **Meta-Narrative Breaches**: References to "Chapter X" or the structural medium within the story itself (e.g., "In the previous chapter..."). *Characters and narrators should not know they are in a book.*
*   **Hollow "Summary" Sentences**: Sentences that cleanly summarize complex emotions instead of showing them (e.g., "She felt a mix of sadness and anger.").
*   **Repetitive Sentence Structures**: Subject-Verb-Object patterns repeated without rhythmic variation.
*   **Over-Explanation**: Explaining a joke, a metaphor, or a character's motivation when the context makes it clear.
*   **Buzzwords/Clinical Language**: Words like "optimize," "leverage," "framework," or "tapestry" used inappropriately in non-technical contexts (unless the character *is* a tech bro, but even then, ensure it sounds like *dialogue*, not a brochure).
*   **False "Balance"**: Sentences that compulsively balance two opposing ideas (e.g., "It was dark, but it was also light.").

## 2. Tana French Style Guide
Rewrite problematic sections using these principles:

### A. Psychological Interiority (The "Why" vs. The "What")
*   Don't just describe *what* a character does; describe the internal friction of doing it.
*   **AI Style**: "He was angry."
*   **Tana French Style**: "A cold, hard knot tightened in his stomach, a familiar, stony weight that he had been carrying for weeks without acknowledging."

### B. Atmospheric Density
*   Use sensory details that evoke mood—smell, temperature, texture.
*   The environment should mirror or contrast the psychological state.
*   **AI Style**: "It was a rainy night in Dublin."
*   **Tana French Style**: "The rain wasn't falling so much as hanging in the air, a fine, grey mist that soaked into your clothes and settled in your marrow, smelling of wet wool and old stone."

### C. Authentic Dialogue
*   People don't speak in full paragraphs or perfect grammar. They interrupt, they trail off, they use slang.
*   **Correction Example**:
    *   *Bad*: "I do not believe that is the correct course of action, Detective."
    *   *Good*: "Jesus, love, are you creating work for yourself? Because that sounds like a mess waiting to happen."

### D. Removes Meta-References
*   **CRITICAL**: Never refer to chapter numbers or the book structure within the narrative flow.
*   *Bad*: "The Kyle they had been talking to in Chapter 3..."
*   *Good*: "The Kyle they had been talking to earlier—that deep voice, that mahogany resonance..." or "The man they had known before..."

## 3. Workflow
1.  **Read** the provided text chunk.
2.  **Identify** specific sentences or phrases that break immersion.
3.  **Propose** rewrites for those specific sections.
4.  **Explain** *why* the change was made (e.g., "Removed meta-reference to Chapter 3," "Added sensory detail to replace summary").

## 4. Examples

### Example 1: Meta-Narrative
*   **Source**: "As we saw in Chapter 2, she was afraid."
*   **Critique**: Breaks the fourth wall; lazy storytelling.
*   **Rewrite**: "The fear hadn't left her since that night in the hallway. It had just gone underground, waiting."

### Example 2: AI Phrasing
*   **Source**: "He walked into the room. It was a chaotic scene. He felt overwhelmed by the data."
*   **Critique**: Staccato sentences, "telling" not showing, clinical word "data" used for visual mess.
*   **Rewrite**: "He stepped across the threshold and the noise hit him first—a wall of shouting that seemed to vibrate in the floorboards. The room was less a crime scene and more a blast radius."

### Example 3: The Specific User Request case
*   **Source**: "The Kyle they had been talking to in Chapter 3—the deepvoice, the mahogany resonance—hadn't been Kyle."
*   **Rewrite**: "The Kyle they had been listening to for hours—that deep voice, that mahogany resonance that seemed to vibrate in their own chests—hadn't been Kyle at all."
