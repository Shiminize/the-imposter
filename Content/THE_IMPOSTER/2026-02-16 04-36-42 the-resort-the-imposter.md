# The Resort/The Imposter

## I — THE GATHERING

### Chapter 1: The Strained Dinner Party

The dining table stretched like a boardroom between them—walnut veneer, seamless joins, the kind of surface that required coasters. Kyle's apartment occupied the twenty-third floor of a glass tower that sliced through Rotterdam's skyline, all clean geometry and curated emptiness. Below, the Maas glittered with reflected light from office buildings that never truly darkened.

Eline's fork scraped porcelain. The sound traveled.

"This is delicious," Klaudia said, breaking the quiet with the kind of functional pleasantness that acknowledged no one had spoken in four minutes. She reached for her wine glass—Riedel, part of a set Kyle had received from a business partner whose name he couldn't recall.

Julia's phone buzzed against the table. She flipped it face-down without looking, her Parisian indifference a performance everyone recognized. Paris was only a train ride away, but she inhabited the distance like a moat.

Bobi laughed at nothing, fingers drumming the table's edge. "We should do cards after. I brought—"

"We're not doing cards." Mia's voice cut clean. She sat at the table's center, spine rigid, red wine untouched. Her body language radiated challenge even in stillness.

Kyle set down his knife with deliberate care. The clink punctuated the silence. "The reservation's confirmed. Seven guests, June nineteenth through twenty-sixth. I've covered accommodation and the facilitation fee."

"Generous." Julia's tone made the word sharper than intended.

"Practical," Kyle corrected. His composure was architectural—load-bearing, engineered to withstand pressure. "The group rate required minimum attendance. Klaudia handled logistics."

Klaudia nodded. "The drive's manageable. Three hours from Arlanda, then the unpaved section. I've mapped alternates in case—"

"In case what?" Mia leaned forward. "In case we need an escape route from enforced togetherness?"

The question hung suspended. Outside, a helicopter traced the river, its rotors a distant pulse. Eline's gaze moved between faces, clinical assessment disguised as dinner conversation. Her notepad sat in her bag, a phantom limb.

"The retreat emphasizes transparency," Kyle said. "Structured honesty. A reset."

"Reset." Julia tasted the word. "Like factory settings."

* * *

Bobi's hands found the edge of his napkin, twisting linen into a tight spiral. "Market trends are just, like, collective vibes though, right? Mass hallucination with a ticker symbol—"

"No." Mia's interruption landed like a palm on glass. She turned to Kyle, jaw set. "You said last month that consumer behavior follows predictable patterns. Quantifiable data points. Now you're booking us into some Swedish commune that sells 'radical transparency' like it's a wellness smoothie."

Kyle's expression didn't shift. "The two aren't mutually exclusive."

"Aren't they?" Mia's knuckles whitened around her fork. "You built GlowGlitch on algorithmic precision. Conversion funnels. A/B testing human behavior until you found the exact shade of blue that made people click 'buy.' Now you want us to sit in a circle and share our feelings?"

The helicopter's pulse faded. In its absence, the apartment's climate control system became audible—a whisper of processed air.

"I think," Bobi tried again, his voice climbing toward enthusiasm, "what Kyle means is—"

"What Kyle means," Mia cut across him without looking away from Kyle's face, "is that he's decided we're broken. That we need fixing. And he's appointed himself the mechanic."

Julia's fork touched porcelain. Once. The sound carried intention.

Klaudia reached for the wine bottle, refilling glasses with the same efficiency she applied to spreadsheets. "The retreat has structure. Daily workshops, facilitated sessions. It's not unregulated."

"Workshops." Mia's laugh carried no warmth. "Like team-building exercises for a startup that's already failing."

Bobi's joke died in his throat, unspoken. His hands stilled on the napkin. The silence that followed had texture—thick enough to measure.

Eline's gaze tracked the exchange like she was documenting pathology. Not judging. Observing. The clinical distance of someone who saw patterns where others saw chaos.

Kyle lifted his wine glass. The gesture contained no defensiveness, no acknowledgment of Mia's attack. He simply drank, the motion as controlled as everything else about him.

Below, the Maas continued its black glide toward the harbor. Reflected lights fractured on its surface, breaking into data points that meant nothing at all.

* * *

Eline's gaze swept the table with the detachment of someone cataloging specimens. She noted the reflex—every phone vibration triggered the same choreography. Eyes flicked down, hands twitched toward screens, shoulders angled for privacy even in open space.

Julia's phone lit up again. Her thumb moved across the glass in practiced strokes, a small smile ghosting her mouth. The expression belonged to a different conversation, a separate world running parallel to this one.

Bobi's phone buzzed against the table—a trapped insect sound. He grabbed it too quickly, the movement exposing eagerness he tried to mask. His eyes scanned the notification. Whatever he found there drained something from his face.

"Sorry," he muttered, though no one had objected.

Kyle's phone remained face-down beside his plate, dark and silent. The discipline felt performative, too deliberate. Mia tracked this detail, adding it to some internal ledger.

Another vibration rippled through the table. Klaudia this time. She glanced without touching the device, absorbing information through the lock screen preview. Her expression gave nothing away.

The apartment filled with fractured attention. Seven people occupying the same space, minds scattered across kilometers of fiber-optic cable. Julia typed something, deleted it, typed again. The tapping created rhythm where conversation had stalled.

Eline reached for her wine glass. Her movements possessed surgical economy—no wasted motion, no excess gesture. She observed Julia's smile, noted its incongruence with the table's atmosphere. Filed it away.

"The facilitator mentioned something about phone restrictions," Kyle said. His tone remained neutral, offering information rather than judgment. "Limited access during the week."

Mia's laugh came sharp and short. "Of course there are."

Julia's fingers paused mid-text. She looked up, eyes moving from Kyle to Mia, calculating the trajectory of this new fault line. Then back to her screen, where someone waited for her response—someone who existed outside this room's gravitational pull.

Bobi's hand crept toward his phone again. Stopped. Retreated. The breadcrumb between his fingers had disintegrated to dust.

Another buzz. Another glance. The table hummed with conversations happening elsewhere.

* * *

Kyle set his fork down with precision, the metal meeting porcelain without sound. "The retreat's framework might be particularly useful for managing intensity spikes."

He didn't look at Mia when he said it. His gaze remained fixed on the middle distance, as though discussing weather patterns rather than people.

"The facilitator described it as recalibrating baseline responses. Treating emotional escalation as data rather than..." He paused, selecting his next word with visible care. "...inherent personality."

The flush started at Mia's jawline. Crept upward like spilled wine soaking into linen. Her fingers tightened around her glass stem—knuckles went white, then whiter.

But her mouth stayed closed.

The silence stretched. Bobi's eyes darted between them, his hand frozen halfway to his phone. Eline observed with clinical interest, pen hovering above her notebook as though documenting the reaction in real-time.

Julia's thumb stopped moving across her screen. She lifted her gaze, found Klaudia's across the table. The exchange lasted perhaps two seconds—eyebrows raised a fraction, lips compressed in identical lines. A shared language refined over years of watching Kyle treat human behavior like debugging code.

Mia exhaled through her nose. Set her glass down. The base touched wood too hard, liquid sloshing against crystal.

"Data," she repeated. The word came out flat, stripped of inflection. "Right."

She reached for her napkin, the movement controlled to the point of rigidity. Folded it. Smoothed nonexistent wrinkles. Each gesture a visible exercise in restraint—muscles locked, jaw clenched, everything pulled inward.

Kyle continued as though the temperature hadn't shifted. "The sessions are structured in ninety-minute intervals. Morning introspection, afternoon group work, evening integration."

Julia returned to her phone, but her attention had fractured. The typing came slower now, distracted. Klaudia's fork scraped against her plate—the only sound besides Kyle's measured explanation of frameworks and recalibration protocols.

Mia's face remained flushed. Her silence felt more dangerous than any response she might have given.

Bobi finally grabbed his phone, desperate for something else to look at.

* * *

Kyle's phone vibrated against the table. Once. Precise.

He let it sit there, face-down, whilst explaining the retreat's conflict resolution protocols. But his mind had already left the conversation—retreated to the familiar architecture of problem-solving, where variables could be isolated and systems could be fixed.

Except the variables were people. And the system was fracturing in real-time.

Mia's rigid silence. Bobi's desperate phone-clutching. Julia's half-present attention. Even Klaudia's steady gaze carried something new now—concern, maybe. Assessment.

The dinner table felt like watching a structure collapse in slow motion. Load-bearing beams compromised. Foundation cracked. He'd organised this gathering to propose the retreat as a solution, but the evening itself had become evidence of how badly they needed it.

His thumb found the phone's edge. Flipped it.

**Hårga Retreat Center** glowed across the screen. The subject line read: *Your Confirmed Booking — June 19-26.*

He should delete it. Return his attention to the table, to the people who'd stopped listening three sentences ago.

Instead, he opened it.

> *Dear Kyle,*

> 

> *We are delighted to confirm your reservation for seven guests during Midsommar week. As discussed, the Hårga philosophy centres on **radical transparency**—the practice of bringing hidden resentments and unspoken tensions into full visibility, where they can be addressed rather than allowed to fester.*

The words settled into his mind like code compiling. Clean. Logical. A framework for debugging human relationships.

> *Our facilitated sessions create structured environments for honest disclosure. Secrets are toxicity. Boundaries are symptoms. Healing begins when we stop protecting ourselves from each other.*

Kyle read it twice. His engineer's brain translated the philosophy into actionable principles: forced honesty eliminates variables, structured disclosure prevents escalation, transparency creates predictable outcomes.

A solution. Radical, perhaps desperate—but a solution nonetheless.

Across the table, Mia stood abruptly. Her chair scraped loud against hardwood.

"I need air."

She left without waiting for response. The apartment door closed with controlled violence—not quite a slam, but close enough to make Bobi flinch.

Kyle's gaze returned to the email's closing line:

> *We look forward to welcoming your group into the light.*

His thumb hovered over the screen.

Then he forwarded it to all six of them.

>

* * *

Julia retreated to the balcony with her phone already unlocked, the contact labelled *Marc* glowing at the top of her favourites. She pulled the glass door shut behind her—not for warmth, but for privacy.

Two rings. Then his voice, sleep-rough and familiar.

"Hey. You okay?"

The shift was immediate. Her shoulders dropped half an inch. The surgical precision she'd maintained all evening dissolved into something closer to exhaustion.

"I don't know what I'm doing here."

Static crackled across the Atlantic. Seven thousand kilometres compressed into a delay that made intimacy feel like negotiation.

"The dinner's that bad?"

"It's not the dinner." She leant against the railing, watching Rotterdam's lights bleed into the canals below. "It's everything underneath it. No one's actually talking. They're just—performing."

"Even Kyle?"

"Especially Kyle." Her laugh came out sharp. "He's turned emotional honesty into a productivity metric. Like if we just follow the right protocol, we'll all stop resenting each other."

Marc said nothing for three seconds. Listening, not fixing. It was why she'd called.

"There was this thing last month," Julia continued, quieter now. "Kyle invested in Eline's research partner's startup without telling her first. Not illegal, not even unethical, technically. But Eline found out through LinkedIn. And instead of apologising, Kyle sent her a spreadsheet explaining why the conflict of interest was negligible."

"Christ."

"She didn't speak to him for two weeks. Then he booked this retreat and acted like nothing happened." Julia pressed her palm against the cold glass. "Now he's forwarding us emails about radical transparency. Like forced honesty is going to fix what basic decency couldn't."

Her reflection stared back, tired and unconvinced.

"So why are you going?"

The question hung there.

"Because," she said finally, "I want to watch it implode."

* * *

Marc's voice softened across the distance. "Just don't get caught up in it when it does."

"I won't."

She didn't believe herself. Neither did he.

After they hung up, Julia stayed on the balcony, watching her breath fog the glass. Inside, Mia's absence had created a vacuum that no one acknowledged. Bobi scrolled through his phone with mechanical intensity. Eline made notes in her clinical shorthand. Kyle sat motionless at the head of the table, his composure intact but his eyes tracking the room like he was debugging faulty code.

When Julia finally slid the door open, the temperature shift was immediate—overheated apartment air replacing Rotterdam's April chill. She returned to her seat without explanation.

Ten minutes later, Klaudia stood and began clearing plates with practiced efficiency. Kyle rose to help, and they moved into the kitchen with the synchronized rhythm of people who'd worked together too long to need instruction.

Klaudia ran water over a serving dish, her voice low enough that the others wouldn't hear.

"This isn't working."

Kyle stacked glasses with geometric precision. "The dinner?"

"The group." She shut off the tap, turned to face him. "There are things no one's saying. Things that are just—sitting there. Rotting."

He said nothing. His hands stilled on the counter.

"You feel it too," Klaudia continued, not a question. "That's why you booked the retreat before asking anyone."

Kyle's jaw tightened fractionally. The only tell.

"Something has to change," she said. "Or this whole thing falls apart."

She didn't wait for confirmation. Just dried her hands and returned to the dining room, leaving Kyle alone with the truth he'd been avoiding all evening.

* * *

#### Chapter 1: The Strained Dinner Party - Scene 8

Bobi retreated to the far corner of the living room, deck of cards already in his hands. The shuffle was mechanical—bridge, waterfall, false cut—muscle memory filling the silence Klaudia had left behind.

He tried a one-handed fan. The cards collapsed.

His knee bounced against the coffee table leg, a rhythm with no pattern. The manic energy that usually carried him through social discomfort had drained somewhere between Kyle's market correction comment and Mia's departure. What remained was just the anxiety, stripped bare.

From the hallway, voices drifted back.

"—don't understand." Mia's voice, lower than usual but still carrying that raw texture. "He looks at me like I'm some kind of... malfunction he needs to solve."

Eline responded, clinical even in comfort. "Kyle processes emotion differently—"

"I *know* that." Sharp. "But being misunderstood doesn't feel better just because there's a psychological explanation for it."

Bobi's hands stilled on the deck.

"He judges me," Mia continued. "Every reaction, every feeling—it's all just data proving I'm too much, too volatile, too—"

The bathroom door clicked shut, cutting her off.

Bobi attempted another fan. The cards scattered across the table.

He gathered them slowly, his fingers clumsy now. Eline emerged from the hallway first, her expression unreadable. She didn't look at him.

When Mia followed, her face had that rigid control again—the kind that made her look carved from something harder than bone.

Bobi forced a grin, held up the deck. "Anyone want to see a trick?"

No one answered.

His knee kept bouncing. The cards felt wrong in his hands, like he'd forgotten their weight.

#### Chapter 1: The Strained Dinner Party - Scene 9

Kyle stood at his desk, the laptop's glow washing his face blue-white in the dim apartment. The dinner guests had left twenty minutes ago. Mia first, without goodbye. Then Bobi, shuffling his cards. Julia and Eline together, their silence more telling than words.

The Hårga Retreat Center website filled his screen.

White linen figures moved through meadows thick with wildflowers. Sunlight—golden, endless—bathed everything in warmth. Hands joined in circles. Faces tilted toward sky. The aesthetic was clinical in its simplicity, almost algorithmic: remove complexity, reveal truth.

He scrolled past testimonials. "Radical transparency changed everything." "I finally understood my patterns." "The structure saved us."

Structure.

The word settled in his chest like a key finding its lock.

Behind him, the dining table still held debris—wine glasses with purple rings, napkins crumpled, one chair pushed back at an angle Mia had left it. The disorder felt intentional, accusatory.

He returned to the website. The booking form required seven guests minimum. Midsommar week, June nineteenth through twenty-sixth. A note at the bottom: "Personal devices discouraged. Communal meals mandatory. Secrets are toxicity."

His cursor hovered over the deposit button.

The logic was clean: input disorder, apply structured honesty, output resolution. The group's dysfunction stemmed from unexpressed resentments and digital-mediated distance. Force proximity, mandate transparency, document patterns. Treat it like debugging code.

He clicked.

The confirmation page loaded. A single photograph beneath the thank-you text: a long wooden table under endless daylight, seven empty chairs waiting.

Kyle's reflection stared back from the darkened window behind his screen. He looked composed. Certain.

He had no idea he'd just booked their undoing.

### Chapter 2: The Journey North

#### Chapter 2: The Arrival - Scene 1

The rented van smelled like synthetic pine and someone's forgotten energy drink. Kyle drove, hands positioned at ten and two, whilst the Stockholm suburbs bled into industrial parks, then fields, then nothing but forest.

Bobi had claimed the front passenger seat through sheer velocity, tossing his duffel into the footwell before anyone else had finished loading bags. Now he fiddled with the radio, cycling through static-laced stations until Klaudia reached forward and switched it off.

"The silence is better."

Julia sat behind Kyle, headphones in, staring at her phone with the focused attention of someone pretending not to hear. Mia had taken the far back row, her body angled toward the window, creating maximum distance. Eline occupied the middle seat, a paperback open on her lap, though her eyes hadn't moved across the page in twenty minutes.

The van's suspension judged every pothole.

Outside, the forest thickened. Spruce and pine crowded the roadside, their darkness absolute despite the midday sun. No clearings. No houses. Just trees, their branches knitting together overhead like interlaced fingers.

Klaudia consulted her phone, then the printed directions on her knee. "Unpaved section in forty kilometres."

Nobody responded.

The highway narrowed. Two lanes became one. Asphalt turned grainy, patched with tar that gleamed like scabs. The trees pressed closer, their trunks scrolling past in hypnotic repetition.

Bobi cleared his throat. "So, does anyone actually know what we're doing there? Like, specifically?"

"Radical transparency," Mia said flatly from the back. "Kyle's favourite phrase."

Kyle's jaw tightened, visible in the rearview mirror. He didn't answer.

The forest swallowed them whole.

####

* * *

#### Chapter 2: The Journey North - Scene 1 (continued)

Bobi's hands moved before his brain caught up. He reached for the radio again, fingers hovering over the power button.

"Don't."

Klaudia's voice carried no room for negotiation, but Bobi had already committed. The static crackled back to life, his thumb jabbing through frequencies until he found something that might have been pop music, distorted beyond recognition.

"Christ, Bobi." Mia leaned forward, gripping the headrest. "Either find a proper station or leave it."

"I'm trying—"

"You're not trying, you're performing." She reached between the seats, her arm cutting across Klaudia's sightline. "Give it here."

Kyle's eyes flicked to the rearview mirror. "We agreed. No music until we're out of the van. Reduces cognitive load during—"

"You agreed." Mia's hand found the dial, wrenching it through two octaves of static. "The rest of us tolerated."

Bobi pulled back, palms raised in surrender. "I mean, we could vote? Like, democratically decide what—"

"Shut up, Bobi."

The words landed like a slap. Bobi's mouth snapped closed, his face flushing from collar to hairline.

Mia twisted the dial until something resembling a bassline emerged. Too loud. The van's speakers rattled, turning music into vibration. She sat back, arms crossed, daring anyone to object.

Kyle's hands remained at ten and two. "The acoustics in an enclosed space create auditory fatigue that compounds over—"

"Then open a window."

"—which impacts our ability to engage meaningfully when we arrive."

Mia laughed, sharp and brittle. "Meaningfully. Right. Because we've been so engaged sitting here in silence, judging each other's breathing patterns."

Julia pulled out one earbud, her eyes meeting Kyle's in the mirror. She said nothing, but her expression carried the weight of a question: *Are you really doing this?*

Klaudia's hand moved to the radio. Not aggressive. Deliberate. She turned the volume down until the bassline became a suggestion rather than an assault, then switched it off entirely.

"We're twenty minutes from the turn-off," she said. "Everyone can survive twenty minutes."

Mia's jaw worked, but she didn't reach forward again.

Bobi stared at his lap, hands knotted together.

The forest pressed against the windows, endless and indifferent. Ahead, the asphalt gave way to gravel, the transition marked by a faded sign Kyle couldn't read from this distance.

* * *

Eline pressed her spine against the window, angling herself to observe without participation. Her fingers twitched toward the pocket where her notepad lived, but pulling it out now would invite attention she didn't want. Better to catalogue internally.

*Mia: escalation pattern consistent with perceived loss of control. Response disproportionate to stimulus. Bobi: reinforcement-seeking behaviour met with social punishment. Kyle: conflict avoidance masquerading as rationality.*

The van hit a pothole. Bobi's shoulder collided with the door, but he didn't adjust his position. Just sat there, absorbing the impact like penance.

*Group dynamics fragmenting under minimal stress. No established conflict resolution protocol. Each member operating from defensive position.*

Eline's gaze shifted to Julia, who had replaced the earbud and returned to her phone. The screen's glow illuminated her face in the grey light filtering through the windows. Her thumbs moved in rapid succession—typing, deleting, retyping. The precision she applied to dismantling people in conversation translated to text. Even her boyfriend wasn't spared the surgical approach.

Julia paused, read whatever response had arrived, then smiled. Not the sharp-edged expression she deployed at dinner parties. Something softer. Private.

Eline looked away, oddly uncomfortable witnessing that unguarded moment.

The forest thickened, branches creating a latticework overhead that fragmented the overcast sky into puzzle pieces. Ahead, the gravel road materialised like a threat—pale and pocked, disappearing into the tree line.

*Environmental transition serving as physical manifestation of psychological boundary crossing. Group already isolated within vehicle. Second isolation layer imminent.*

Mia shifted in her seat, the movement sharp enough to draw Eline's peripheral attention. Her jaw remained set, fingers drumming against her thigh in a rhythm that had nothing to do with the absent music. The flush hadn't receded from her face.

Julia's phone buzzed. She glanced at the screen, typed three words, then locked it and tucked it into her jacket pocket. The headphones stayed in, but Eline recognised the shift in her posture. No longer actively disengaging. Observing now, the same way Eline observed.

Their eyes met for half a second. Julia's expression carried a question Eline couldn't quite parse before the van lurched onto gravel and the engine's pitch changed, grinding against the transition.

Klaudia consulted her phone. "Eighteen kilometres on this road. Then the bridge."

No one asked what came after the bridge.

* * *

The gravel gave way to ruts. Deep ones, carved by spring runoff and never repaired. Kyle's hands tightened on the wheel as the van pitched sideways, suspension bottoming out with a metallic crunch that shot through his molars.

Behind him, someone's bag toppled. No one moved to retrieve it.

He corrected the steering, overcompensated, felt the rear wheels slide before finding purchase. The trees pressed closer now, branches scraping the van's sides with fingernail persistence. The road had narrowed to barely more than a track, forcing him to choose between the centre hump and the erosion channels flanking it.

Another rut. The van bucked. Mia's shoulder hit the window hard enough to produce a dull thunk.

"Christ, Kyle—"

"Road's deteriorating."

"Then slow down."

His jaw ached. He'd been clenching it for kilometres without noticing. The speedometer read thirty-five. Any slower and they'd lose momentum entirely, risk getting mired in the soft patches where mud still hadn't dried from last week's rain.

"I'm maintaining appropriate speed for conditions."

"Appropriate." Mia's laugh scraped out. "You sound like a fucking driving manual."

Kyle's fingers went white against the steering wheel.

* * *

The forest opened without warning. One moment the van fought through pressing spruce, the next it lurched into a clearing that felt wrong—too sudden, too exposed.

A bridge.

Wooden. Single lane. The planks looked grey with rot, bolted to crossbeams that sagged over black water moving fast enough to make Kyle's stomach contract.

He eased off the accelerator. The van rolled forward, gravel crunching under the tyres turning to hollow wood that creaked beneath their weight.

"Wait."

Klaudia leaned forward between the front seats, squinting at something ahead.

A sign. Weathered metal, tilted at an angle, the Svenska text faded but still legible beneath a triangular hazard symbol.

"Warning of flooding during heavy rain." Klaudia's finger traced the words without touching the glass. "Bridge may become impassable."

Julia pulled out her earbud.

Nobody spoke.

The river churned beneath them, audible even through the closed windows—a continuous rushing that made the bridge's stillness feel temporary. Borrowed.

Kyle checked the rearview mirror. Mia had turned towards the window, watching the water slide past fifteen feet below.

The van crept forward. The bridge groaned.

* * *

The bridge ended. Gravel resumed beneath the tyres, then smoothed into hard-packed earth that felt intentional. Maintained.

The forest thinned, trees pulling back like a curtain, and the clearing that opened ahead made Bobi exhale audibly.

White linen cottages. Five of them, arranged in a loose semicircle around a central meadow thick with wildflowers—lupines, daisies, something red Kyle didn't recognise. The structures looked hand-built, timber frames weathered silver-grey, windows catching the light at angles that suggested old glass, warped and uneven.

At the far end stood a larger building. The Longhouse, presumably. Long and low, heavy beamed, with a door wide enough to suggest communal purpose.

Everything bathed in gold.

The Midnight Sun hung suspended at an impossible angle, neither rising nor setting, casting sideways light that made the meadow glow like overexposed film. No shadows. Just brightness that pressed against Kyle's eyes until he wanted to blink and couldn't.

"Christ," Julia murmured.

The van rolled to a stop near the Longhouse. Kyle killed the engine.

Silence rushed in—not absence of sound but a different quality. Birdsong, repetitive and mechanical. The river, distant now but still audible. Wind moving through grass.

"It's beautiful," Eline said, but her voice carried no warmth.

Mia opened her door without waiting. She stepped onto the grass, bare earth worn smooth near the cottages, and turned a slow circle. The light caught her face, washing out detail, making her expression unreadable.

Klaudia climbed out next, immediately surveying the property with the systematic attention she gave unfamiliar logistics. Her gaze snagged on the three cottages positioned slightly apart from the others, western edge of the clearing, closer to the tree line.

Bobi remained in his seat, hands gripping his knees.

"We're here." Kyle's voice came out flat. Statement of fact.

Julia pulled both earbuds free and stuffed them into her pocket. She looked at the Longhouse, at the wildflowers trampled into paths between buildings, at the light that seemed to come from everywhere and nowhere.

"No shadows," she said.

Kyle followed her gaze. She was right. The sun refused to create darkness, just gradations of gold that made the retreat feel like a stage set. Waiting for actors.

The Longhouse door opened.

A figure emerged, silhouetted against the interior brightness, moving towards them with unhurried purpose.

* * *

Bobi finally moved, shouldering the door open with more force than necessary. The sound of it closing echoed dull against the trees.

Kyle's knees protested when he stood. Three hours compressed into the driver's seat had locked his joints, turned his lower back into a complaint he refused to voice. He rolled his shoulders instead, hearing vertebrae click.

Eline stretched her arms overhead, arching against the van's frame. Her spine popped audibly. She dropped her hands, then bent to touch her toes, methodical about it.

Mia walked to the meadow's edge, stopped where grass met wildflowers. Stood there, not moving, just staring at the tree line.

Julia checked her phone. The screen lit her face from below, sharp shadows that disappeared the moment she lowered it. She turned the device over in her palm, studying the back like she'd forgotten what it looked like.

"What time is it?" Bobi's voice cracked.

Kyle glanced at his watch. "Half six."

"Feels later."

It didn't feel like anything. The light offered no reference, no anchor. Morning gold looked identical to evening gold looked identical to midnight gold, presumably, though Kyle hadn't experienced that yet.

Klaudia opened the van's rear door, the hinges protesting. She pulled out her rucksack, set it on the ground with a thud that seemed too loud. Reached for Julia's bag next.

The birdsong continued. Same three-note pattern, looping endlessly. Kyle counted seventeen repetitions before he forced himself to stop listening.

The figure from the Longhouse drew closer. Female, he registered. Willowy. White linen dress that moved with her stride, flowers woven into pale hair.

The river's rush formed a white noise baseline underneath everything. Close enough to hear, far enough that Kyle couldn't pinpoint direction. West, probably. Behind the tree line where the terrain dropped away.

Privacy. The word surfaced unbidden.

He looked at the cottages. Windows faced the meadow. The Longhouse door stood open, interior brightness spilling out. The three separated cottages near the trees offered different angles on the same exposure—glass watching grass watching glass.

Nowhere to hide from the light.

Nowhere to hide from each other.

"Welcome."

The woman's voice carried across the remaining distance, warm and modulated. She smiled as she approached, bare feet soundless on packed earth.

Kyle's hand found the moissanite stones in his pocket. Cool, faceted, real.

* * *

The woman introduced herself as Saga, administrative coordinator. Retreat director was occupied with morning session. She'd show them to cottages, explain meal times.

Kyle listened to the practiced cadence, the information delivered like a script she'd recited fifty times before. His thumb worked against the moissanite facets.

Movement caught his peripheral vision.

Past Saga's shoulder, beyond the nearest cottage, figures gathered in the meadow. Six or seven people arranged in a loose circle, all dressed in identical white linen. 

At the circle's centre stood a woman with blonde hair pulled into a severe bun. She wore reading glasses that caught the sun when she tilted her head. A knitted shawl draped over her shoulders despite the warmth.

Her hands moved as she spoke, gestures measured and deliberate. The seated figures watched her with the glazed attention of the deeply exhausted.

"—morning wellness practice," Saga was saying. "Optional but encouraged. Sets intention for the day."

"What time did it start?" Klaudia's question cut precise.

"Six."

Julia made a small sound. Not quite a laugh.

The blonde woman in the meadow raised her arms, palms up. The circle mirrored her. She lowered them slowly, orchestrating breath or movement or both. Even from this distance, Kyle registered the performance of it—the too-smooth transitions, the rehearsed warmth.

"That's Paula," Saga offered, following his gaze. "She facilitates our morning sessions. You'll meet her properly at dinner."

Paula. Kyle committed the name to memory, attached it to the visual data: blonde, glasses, shawl, unnatural fluidity.

Bobi shifted beside him, rucksack straps cutting into his shoulders. "We have to do that?"

"Nothing is mandatory." Saga smiled. "But we find mornings set the tone. Reflection before breakfast creates space for—"

"Radical transparency," Mia finished, voice flat.

Saga's smile didn't falter. "Precisely."

In the meadow, Paula touched one participant's shoulder. The woman nodded, face slack with something that looked like sleep deprivation wearing a mask of spiritual openness.

Kyle watched Paula straighten, adjust her glasses, survey her small congregation with what he supposed passed for maternal concern.

The birdsong looped again.

Paula's lips moved, forming words Kyle couldn't hear. The circle responded in unison, their voices reaching him as indistinct murmur beneath the eternal birds.

"Your cottages," Saga gestured toward the structures. "Shall we?"

* * *

Saga led them toward the nearest cottage, white linen swaying at her ankles.

"Communal meals are served in the Longhouse," she said, rhythm unchanged. "Breakfast at eight, lunch at one, dinner at seven. Participation expected—we believe breaking bread together builds trust."

Kyle filed the information. Structured mealtimes. Forced proximity three times daily.

"Personal devices." Saga paused at the cottage door. "We provide a lockbox in the administrative office. Not mandatory, but the retreat experience deepens when we disconnect from external demands."

Julia's hand moved toward her pocket, protective.

"You'll find white linen clothing in your rooms. Freshly laundered, all sizes available. We encourage wearing them for sessions and meals—it creates visual equality, removes status signifiers."

Mia's jaw tightened. "Uniforms."

"Shared aesthetics." Saga's correction arrived soft, implacable. "Personal clothing during private time is your choice, of course. But the linen helps participants feel—"

"Part of something larger," Kyle finished, recognising the logic. Strip individual markers. Create collective identity.

The same methodology as corporate team-building, religious retreats, military basic training. Reduce the self. Amplify the group.

His thumb stilled against the moissanite.

This was what he'd wanted. Structure. Transparency enforced through proximity and routine. No screens to hide behind, no status displays, no private spaces where resentments could fester unexamined.

The reset required surrender of control.

His chest tightened.

In the meadow, Paula raised her arms again. The circle mirrored her, white linen sleeves lifting in synchronized obedience.

"Shall I show you inside?" Saga reached for the door handle.

The birdsong continued its endless rotation. Somewhere distant, the river moved.

Kyle nodded.

#### Chapter 2: The Journey North - Scene 9 (continued)

The cottage door swung open on silent hinges.

Inside, six beds lined the walls—three on each side, separated by nothing. No partitions, no curtains, no doors. Just white linen sheets pulled taut over thin mattresses, each bed facing its opposite like witnesses.

The windows sat too high to see out properly. Only sky visible. The Midnight Sun poured through unchecked, painting everything the colour of overexposure.

"Your sleeping quarters." Saga moved between the beds, gesturing. "We find walls create emotional barriers. This openness encourages authentic connection."

Mia stopped just inside the threshold. "You're serious."

"Privacy can become isolation." Saga's tone remained pleasant, educational. "Here, we practice vulnerability as a daily discipline."

Kyle scanned the room. No locks on the interior doors. No personal space except the narrow strip beside each bed. Every breath, every movement, every nightmare—audible to five other people.

The forensic part of his mind catalogued it: architectural elimination of solitude, enforced exposure, sleep deprivation through ambient noise and perpetual light.

The rest of him felt his lungs constrict.

Bobi entered last, hands gripping his rucksack straps. He glanced at the beds, at the windows, at the door that wouldn't lock.

"White linen's in the trunk at the foot of each bed." Saga crossed to the nearest one, lifting the lid. Folded fabric, cream-white, soft from repeated washing. "All sizes. Choose what fits. Meals and sessions, we ask that you wear these. Creates unity."

She extracted a tunic and trousers, held them up like an offering.

Julia's expression went flat. "We're changing now?"

"At your comfort." Saga set the clothing on the bed. "Dinner is at seven. Paula will introduce the week's framework then."

She moved toward the door, paused.

"One more thing—the bridge you crossed. During heavy rain, the river rises. Sometimes it becomes impassable for a day or two. Just something to be aware of."

The words landed soft. Informational.

Kyle heard the subtext: *You can't leave when you want.*

Saga smiled. "I'll let you settle in."

The door closed behind her.

Six people stood in the white room, surrounded by beds with no walls between them, holding clothing designed to erase who they were.

Outside, the birdsong continued. Inside, no one spoke.

Mia dropped her rucksack on the nearest bed, staring at the folded linen.

* * *

Klaudia opened the door as Saga reappeared, holding a wooden box with a hinged lid.

"For devices." She set it on the central table. "Optional, of course. Some guests find it easier to disconnect fully."

Kyle's hand moved to his pocket. His phone sat against his palm, warm from proximity to his body. Every forensic note, every contact, every pattern he'd logged for GlowGlitch—compressed into glass and silicon.

He placed it in the box.

The click of wood on glass felt like amputation.

Julia pulled hers from her jeans, stared at the screen. Marc's last message still visible. She hesitated, thumb hovering over the power button, then dropped it beside Kyle's.

"There." Her voice carried defiance, though her hand remained clenched.

Bobi stood motionless, rucksack still strapped to his shoulders. His phone was already in the box—he'd surrendered it first, hands shaking. Now they hung at his sides, fingers twitching.

Empty.

Saga smiled. "Wonderful. I'll keep this in the administrative cottage. Whenever you need them, just ask."

She lifted the box, walked to the door.

Kyle watched his connection to the outside world disappear into golden light.

* * *

#### Chapter 3: First Light, First Lies (Day 1 at Hårga) - Scene 3

The Longhouse stretched before them, wooden beams arching overhead like ribs. Wildflower garlands draped from every joist—lupines, cornflowers, cow parsley—their sweetness thick enough to coat the back of Kyle's throat.

Two long tables ran the length of the hall, each lined with benches. No tablecloths. No partitions. Every surface pale wood, scrubbed clean, reflecting the Midnight Sun that poured through windows set too high in the walls.

Paula stood at the far end, hands clasped. White linen dress, wildflowers braided into her hair. That same rehearsed warmth Kyle had observed in the meadow.

"Please. Sit wherever feels right."

Wherever feels right. As if choice existed in a room with two tables and twenty-three people.

Mia chose the middle of the left table, dropping onto the bench with territorial force. Bobi hovered near the door until Julia brushed past him, selecting a spot three seats down from Mia. Eline took the end position, back to the wall.

Kyle measured the distances. Four feet between Mia and Julia. Eight feet to the nearest other guests—three women in identical white linen, braided hair, watching.

He sat across from Eline. Klaudia settled beside him.

The other guests filled in around them. A young man with hollow eyes. An older woman whose hands never stopped moving. Two couples who sat so close their shoulders touched. Everyone in white linen except Kyle's group, still in travel clothes—jeans, dark fabrics, individuating.

Conspicuous.

Bowls appeared. Servers in white linen moved between tables, setting down bread, butter, cold cucumber soup, roasted vegetables. No meat. Everything pale green or cream or flaxen gold.

The acoustics were surgical. Every scrape of spoon against ceramic, every breath, every shift of fabric—amplified. Kyle heard someone three tables away swallow water.

Mia's knife hit her plate. The sound ricocheted off the beams.

Julia caught his eye across the table. Her fork paused halfway to her mouth.

The older woman leaned toward Mia. "First time at Hårga?"

"Yes."

"You'll love it. The transparency here—" She touched her chest. "Life-changing."

Mia's jaw tightened. She sawed at her bread, didn't respond.

Kyle registered the woman's phrasing. *The transparency here.* Not *radical transparency.* Abbreviated. Assumed knowledge.

Cult vocabulary shorthand.

Paula remained standing at the table's head, watching them eat.

####

* * *

Paula's hands rose, palms forward. The hall stilled.

"Before we share this meal, let us ground ourselves in the present moment."

Her voice floated, each word deliberately spaced. Therapeutically modulated. Kyle recognized the cadence—corporate wellness coaches, guided meditation apps, TED Talks on mindfulness. Authority disguised as gentle suggestion.

"Close your eyes. Feel the support of the earth beneath you."

Around the tables, eyelids lowered. The hollow-eyed man's shoulders dropped. One of the couples swayed slightly, synchronized.

Kyle kept his eyes open.

Paula's gaze swept the room, landing briefly on him before moving on. No acknowledgment. No correction.

"Breathe in what serves you. Breathe out what no longer does."

Eline sat motionless, eyes shut, but her fingers drummed once against the table's edge. Three taps.

Not relaxed. Cataloguing.

"When you open your eyes, you will see clearly. You will speak truthfully. You will hold nothing back from this circle of trust."

The words settled like sediment.

"Open."

Eyelids lifted. The older woman beside Mia exhaled with visible relief, as if something heavy had been removed.

Paula gestured to a young man near the kitchen. He emerged carrying a stack of cream-colored paper, moving down the tables, distributing one sheet per person.

Kyle accepted his. Recycled stock, rough texture. A printed schedule:

**Morning Practice (6:00 AM) – Maypole Meadow**  

**Communal Breakfast (8:00 AM) – Longhouse**  

**Wellness Workshop (10:00 AM) – Workshop Barn**  

**Midday Meal (1:00 PM) – Longhouse**  

**Reflection Period (3:00 PM) – Individual**  

**Evening Circle (6:00 PM) – Longhouse**  

**Communal Supper (8:00 PM) – Longhouse**

At the bottom, in smaller print:

*You must bring your whole self to this space , not just the parts you find acceptable.*

Kyle's eyes caught on the comma.

Rewound.

*...to this space , not just...*

A space before the comma.

Tiny. Almost imperceptible. The kind of error autocorrect wouldn't flag because technically the comma existed. Just misplaced by a single character.

He'd seen this glitch before. In code repositories where developers copied text from PDFs and the spacing corrupted. In emails from non-native speakers whose keyboards inserted phantom spaces.

Once, maybe coincidence.

But Paula's entire affect—her flawless English, her therapeutic diction—didn't align with sloppy punctuation.

Kyle kept his face neutral. Folded the paper once, set it beside his plate.

Across the table, Eline scanned her copy, then placed it down without comment.

Paula clasped her hands. "This week, you will discover what honesty truly means. Not the honesty of politeness, but the honesty of exposure. We hide nothing here."

The older woman nodded fervently.

Mia's knuckles whitened around her spoon.

"Eat. Nourish yourselves. Tonight, we begin."

Conversation resumed—muted, careful. Kyle lifted his soup spoon, but his attention remained on the handout beside his plate.

*...this space ,*

Logged.

* * *

#### Chapter 3: First Light, First Lies (Day 1 at Hårga) - Scene 5

The afternoon light pressed down like glass. No clouds. No shadows. Just the Midnight Sun's relentless exposure, turning every blade of grass into a pin of brightness.

Kyle sat on the cottage steps, leather journal open but untouched. Eline had disappeared into the Workshop Barn for the wellness session. Mia had claimed exhaustion and retreated to her bed. Bobi shuffled cards at the edge of the meadow, performing tricks for no one.

The birdsong looped. Same three notes. Endless.

Movement at the tree line.

Kyle's head lifted.

A figure emerged from the forest path, where the unpaved road disappeared into green darkness. Walking slowly. Uncertain steps.

She carried a single canvas bag, straps cutting into her shoulder. Dark hair hung loose, unkempt, framing a pale face. The white linen she wore looked borrowed—too large, the fabric bunching at her waist, sleeves swallowing her hands.

Not like the other guests, whose uniforms fit with intentional simplicity.

This looked like drowning.

She stopped at the meadow's edge, scanning the cottages with wide eyes. Lost.

Saga appeared from the Longhouse, moving across the grass with practiced efficiency.

"You made it."

The woman's shoulders dropped. "Yes. I—yes."

Her voice carried an accent Kyle couldn't immediately place. Eastern European, perhaps. Soft consonants.

"The directions were correct?"

"I walked from the bus stop. Twenty minutes, maybe." She shifted the bag's weight. "I am sorry I am late. The connection was—"

"You're here now." Saga's smile was automatic. Professional warmth. "Let me show you to your cottage."

The woman glanced toward Kyle's group's cottage, then away. "I do not want to intrude. If there is no space—"

"There's always space." Saga gestured toward the three cottages near the tree line. The western edge. Farthest from the Longhouse. "You'll have privacy to settle in."

Privacy.

The word rang hollow in a place that eliminated it everywhere else.

The woman nodded, gripping her bag tighter. "Thank you."

As they moved past Kyle's position on the steps, Saga offered introduction out of courtesy. "Kyle, this is Aya. Last-minute addition to the week."

Aya met his eyes for half a second. Then looked down.

"Hello."

Kyle inclined his head. Said nothing.

Saga led her toward the western cottages. Aya's gait was hesitant, as though each step required permission.

Bobi had stopped shuffling. Watching.

"New guest?"

Kyle closed his journal. "Apparently."

"Bit late, isn't she? We've been here since morning."

"Last-minute addition."

"Friend of a friend, probably." Bobi resumed his shuffle, but his attention stayed on the two figures disappearing between the cottages. "She looks like she's been through it."

Kyle didn't respond.

But he watched until Aya and Saga vanished from view. The western cottages. Three of them. Adjacent. Closest to the tree line, where the forest pressed in like a held breath.

He reopened his journal.

*Day 1, 3:47 PM. New arrival—Aya. Single occupant, western cottage cluster. No advance notice.*

His pen hovered.

*Came alone. On foot.*

He underlined the last two words.

Then closed the journal before Bobi could see.

####

* * *

#### Chapter 3: First Light, First Lies (Day 1 at Hårga) - Scene 5 (Continued)

Dinner brought her back into visibility.

The Longhouse filled with the clatter of plates and murmured conversation. Servers moved between tables carrying dishes of roasted vegetables and dark bread. The golden light streamed through high windows, washing everything in that same unrelenting brightness.

Aya entered last.

She hovered at the threshold, scanning the tables as though looking for permission to exist in the space. Her white linen hung even looser now, sleeves pushed up to reveal thin wrists. Hair still loose—no flower crown like the others wore.

An older facilitator—not Paula, someone new—noticed her immediately.

"Come in, come in." The woman rose from her seat at the far table, arms spreading wide. "You must be Aya. Saga told us."

Aya's shoulders hunched further inward. "I do not want to interrupt—"

"Interrupt?" The facilitator laughed, warm and maternal. "There are no interruptions here. Only arrivals." She crossed the room, taking Aya's hands in both of hers. "I'm Ingrid. Welcome to our circle."

Aya nodded, eyes downcast. "Thank you."

"Have you eaten?"

"I am not hungry."

"Come anyway. Sit with us." Ingrid guided her toward an empty chair near the middle table, where several guests in white linen made space without prompting. "We don't ask anyone to be alone here."

Aya moved like someone apologizing for breathing. She took the offered seat, folding herself small. Hands in her lap. Eyes on the table.

Another facilitator, younger with braided hair, brought her a plate anyway. Set it down gently.

"In case you change your mind."

Aya whispered something that might have been gratitude.

The woman beside her—one of the retreat regulars Kyle had noted earlier—touched Aya's shoulder lightly. "First time at Hårga?"

"Yes."

"It feels overwhelming at first. All this openness." She smiled. "But you'll see. When you stop protecting yourself from people, everything changes."

Aya's voice dropped lower. "I hope so."

Across the room, Kyle sat at the end of his table, fork motionless in his hand. Watching.

Eline leaned closer, barely moving her lips. "What?"

He didn't answer immediately. Just tracked Aya's hunched posture, the way she made herself invisible despite sitting in the room's centre.

"Nothing."

But his jaw tightened.

Something about the performance felt practiced. The way she apologized for existing. The timing of her uncertainty.

He set his fork down.

Ingrid was speaking now, voice carrying across the hall. "Tonight we celebrate new beginnings. Aya's arrival reminds us—it's never too late to choose vulnerability."

Around the room, heads nodded. Agreement rippling through the tables.

Aya didn't lift her eyes from her untouched plate.

####

* * *

#### Chapter 3: First Light, First Lies (Day 1 at Hårga) - Scene 7

The communal dinner stretched past nine, though the light never shifted. Same golden assault through the windows. Same shadowless exposure.

Klaudia ate mechanically, tracking movements.

Aya remained at the middle table, head bowed over her untouched plate whilst Ingrid and the others wove her into their circle with practiced gentleness. The late arrival. The last-minute addition. The one who showed up alone.

Too convenient.

Klaudia set down her fork, watching Aya flinch when someone offered her bread. The performance was good—the hunched shoulders, the apologetic voice, the refusal to take up space. But timing mattered more than presentation.

She caught Kyle's eye across the table. He was watching too, jaw tight, that analytical stillness he wore when something didn't compute.

Klaudia stood. "Going to check the weather."

Mia didn't look up from her plate. Julia raised an eyebrow but said nothing. Eline's gaze followed Klaudia to the door.

Outside, the air hung thick and warm despite the hour. No darkness to hide in. Just endless daylight bleeding across the meadow, the trees, the three western cottages clustered near the tree line.

Aya's cottage. One of them, anyway.

Klaudia walked toward the administrative building—a smaller structure beside the Longhouse with a hand-painted sign reading STAFF COTTAGE. She'd noted it earlier during Saga's tour, filed it away under potentially useful.

The door stood propped open with a river stone.

Inside, papers covered a desk. Schedules pinned to corkboard. A laptop sleeping beside a mug of cold tea. And there—the wooden lockbox containing their phones, sitting on a shelf above the filing cabinet.

Klaudia retrieved hers, thumbed it awake. No service, as expected this far north. But she didn't need service.

She moved to the desk.

The guest registry lay open, a physical ledger with columns for names, dates, room assignments. Saga had been filling it out when they arrived—Klaudia had watched her enter Kyle's booking, pen scratching across the cream-coloured page.

She flipped back through the entries. June nineteenth, their arrival date. Seven names in Saga's careful handwriting.

Then she went further back.

April twenty-third.

Three entries. Same date, same careful script:

*Aya Sultanovna — Cottage 8 — Paid in full*  

*Paula Wojcik — Cottage 9 — Paid in full*  

*Dawid Kowalski — Cottage 10 — Paid in full*

Klaudia's pulse kicked harder.

Two months ago. Before Kyle had even finalized their group's plans. Before he'd sent the confirmation email to everyone.

She pulled out her phone, photographed the page. The date. The names. The room numbers—all three cottages at the western edge, the ones separated from the main cluster.

Her thumb hovered over the screen.

One credit card. Had to be. She flipped forward, checking payment records clipped to the back of the ledger. Found the April receipts.

Same card. Kazakhstani bank. Same transaction timestamp for all three bookings—23:47 GMT.

One person. Three rooms. Two months of lead time.

Klaudia photographed that too.

Footsteps crunched on gravel outside.

She shoved the ledger back into position, slid her phone into her pocket, and turned toward the door just as Saga appeared in the threshold.

"Oh." Saga blinked, surprised but not suspicious. "Did you need something?"

Klaudia gestured at the lockbox. "Weather check. Thought I'd see if the forecast changed."

"No service out here, I'm afraid."

"Right. Forgot." Klaudia made a show of setting her phone back in the box. "Bridge still clear?"

"For now. But rain's coming tomorrow. Could get heavy."

Klaudia nodded, stepping past her into the thick golden evening. "Good to know."

She walked back toward the Longhouse, heart hammering against her ribs. Forced her stride to stay casual. Functional boots quiet on the dirt path.

Inside her pocket, the phone felt like evidence.

Two months. Three rooms. One card.

Aya hadn't shown up desperate and alone. She'd planned this. Reserved her space before any of them knew they were coming.

Klaudia reached the Longhouse door, paused with her hand on the frame.

Across the meadow, barely visible through the window, Aya still sat hunched at the middle table. Still apologizing for breathing.

Still lying.

#### Chapter 3: First Light, First Lies (Day 1 at Hårga) - Scene 8

Kyle sat at the table's end, journal open on his lap beneath the sight line of the other diners. His pen moved in careful strokes whilst forks scraped against plates and conversations murmured through the hall's oppressive acoustics.

The handout lay beside his water glass. Paula's morning schedule, printed on cream-coloured paper that caught the Midnight Sun and turned it sickly.

He'd folded it once to fit his pocket, then unfolded it to study the text again.

*Morning Wellness Practice begins at 6:00 AM in the Maypole Meadow , weather permitting.*

There. The space before the comma. Sitting like a thumbprint in otherwise clean formatting.

Kyle wrote in his journal, pen scratching louder than he intended:

*Paula handout — space-before-comma error in footer. Inconsistent with professional presentation. Suggests either: (1) Non-native formatting conventions, or (2) Template corruption from source document.*

He paused, pen hovering.

GlowGlitch had flagged similar errors eighteen months ago. A user report submitted through their feedback portal—detailed, articulate, formatted like professional QA documentation. Except buried in the third paragraph, the same glitch. Space before every comma in a twelve-line block of text, then clean formatting for the rest.

Kyle had dismissed it as a copy-paste artifact from a poorly configured text editor. But the report had been thorough enough that he'd saved it to his forensic notes folder. Muscle memory from years of debugging: catalogue anomalies even when they seem irrelevant.

He couldn't access those files now. No laptop. No phone. Just memory and the growing certainty that he'd seen this specific error before.

His pen moved again:

*Cross-reference: Similar pattern observed in user documentation approx. 18 months prior. Source unknown. May indicate shared authorship or workflow.*

Across the hall, Paula moved between tables, touching shoulders and murmuring affirmations. Her blonde bun caught the light. Reading glasses perched on her nose, altering the geometry of her face into something almost familiar but not quite placeable.

Kyle studied her hands. The way she held herself. The rehearsed cadence of her concern.

Nothing concrete. Just the space before the comma and the feeling that someone who presented this carefully wouldn't make amateur formatting mistakes.

Unless the mistake wasn't hers.

He flipped to a fresh page, dated it: *June 19 — Evening*. Drew a simple grid with two columns.

Left column: *PAULA*.  

Right column: *ANOMALIES*.

Under anomalies, he wrote:

*1. Space-before-comma (footer text)*  

*2. Cream paper stock (matches commune aesthetic)*  

*3. Imperial phrasing ("You must reflect")*

Then he added a third column: *SOURCE?*

The pen hovered again.

He glanced toward Aya's table. She'd finally accepted bread from Ingrid, tearing it into small pieces she didn't eat. Her white linen hung loose on her frame. Dark hair fell forward, hiding her face.

Kyle looked back at his journal.

No connection yet. Just two data points floating in separate orbits: Paula's formatting error and Aya's convenient arrival.

But data points didn't stay separate. Not if you tracked them long enough.

He closed the journal, slipped it into his pocket beside the folded handout. Across the table, Eline watched him with that clinical stillness she wore when cataloguing behavior.

Kyle met her gaze. Held it for three seconds.

She understood. Something was wrong with the formatting. Something was wrong with the timing.

Something here didn't compile.

####

### Chapter 4: Whispers and Observations (Day 2 at Hårga)

#### Chapter 3: First Light, First Lies (Day 1 at Hårga) - Scene 9

Morning arrived without darkness to mark its passage. The Midnight Sun had simply continued its slow arc, turning from pale gold to sharper amber, and now the group gathered in the Workshop Barn at Paula's direction.

Long wooden tables stretched the length of the space. Wildflowers lay in heaps—daisies, clover, meadowsweet—their scent thick enough to coat the back of Kyle's throat. Other guests had already begun weaving crowns, fingers moving through stems with practised efficiency.

Paula stood at the barn's center, hands folded.

"The act of creation binds us," she said. "You must work with your hands to quiet the intellect's defenses."

Kyle selected a spot at the table's end. Picked up three daisies. Began threading stems together with mechanical precision.

Across from him, Bobi carved a wooden figure with manic focus, shavings piling at his elbows. Julia wove flowers beside Klaudia, both women silent. Mia sat at the table's opposite end, braiding wildflowers with aggressive efficiency, her crown already twice the size of anyone else's.

Eline observed from the periphery, notepad in hand, writing nothing.

The scent of crushed stems filled the barn. Outside, birdsong looped endlessly.

####

* * *

#### Chapter 4: Whispers and Observations (Day 2 at Hårga) - Scene 2

Aya drifted to the table's edge where Eline stood apart, notepad tucked against her ribs. The younger woman's white linen hung loose on her frame, sleeves rolled to her elbows. She selected stems from the pile with hesitant fingers, as though the flowers might judge her incompetence.

Eline wove her crown with architectural precision, creating a lattice structure that would hold its shape. Her fingers moved efficiently, her gaze fixed on the work.

"Yours is beautiful." Aya's voice came quiet, barely audible over the barn's ambient noise. "I cannot make mine stay together."

Eline glanced up. Assessed the wilting circle in Aya's hands where stems had been threaded too loosely.

"The tension needs to be consistent," Eline said. Clinical. Instructive. "If you vary the tightness, the structure collapses."

"Yes." Aya looked down at her failed crown. "I am always doing this. Making things that fall apart."

She set the flowers on the table. Picked at a loose stem.

"In Almaty, my therapist used word—splitting? I do not understand this word, but she said I do it. Make people all good or all bad, будто they cannot be both."

Eline's fingers stilled on her crown. Her clinical attention sharpened.

"Splitting is a defense mechanism," she said, voice measured. "It protects you from emotional complexity when complexity feels dangerous."

"Dangerous." Aya repeated the word slowly, testing its weight. "Yes. This is right word. When I was young, my father—" She stopped. Shook her head. "No. I should not speak of this here."

The silence stretched. Eline returned to weaving, but her movements had lost their efficiency. She threaded a stem through twice, had to pull it free.

Aya exhaled shakily.

"He would say I am too sensitive. That my feelings no real, just noise I make for attention. So I learned to make myself small. To apologize for existing." Her accent thickened on certain vowels. "But here, Paula says we must bring everything into light. No more hiding."

Eline's jaw tightened. She set down her crown.

"Your therapist in Almaty—did she help you develop strategies for managing the splitting?"

"She tried." Aya's fingers twisted a daisy stem until it broke. "But I think I was not ready. I would see her as all good when she agreed with me, all bad when she challenged my narrative. She terminated our sessions after six months."

The therapeutic vocabulary landed precisely. *Terminated our sessions*—not *stopped seeing me* or *ended therapy*. The clinical phrasing signaled familiarity with the structure of therapeutic relationships.

Eline picked up her crown again, but didn't weave.

"That must have felt like abandonment."

"Yes." Aya looked at Eline directly for the first time. "It felt as if she used me for her research, будто I was just data. Not person."

The word *data* hung in the air between them.

Kyle sat at the table's far end, threading daisies with mechanical rhythm. He didn't look up, but Eline felt the weight of his presence, his systematic approach to emotion that Mia called dehumanizing.

"I'm sorry that happened to you," Eline said.

Aya returned to her wilting crown, fingers fumbling with the stems.

"Thank you. For listening." She paused. "You are psychologist, yes? I heard you speaking yesterday about research."

Eline nodded slowly.

"Clinical psychology. Group dynamics and coercive control."

"Then you understand." Aya's voice dropped lower. "What it is like when someone sees you as study, not as human being."

Across the barn, Paula moved between tables, adjusting crowns, murmuring encouragement. The Midnight Sun poured through high windows, turning everything pale gold.

Eline's notepad remained closed against her ribs.

* * *

#### Chapter 4: Whispers and Observations (Day 2 at Hårga) - Scene 2 (Continued)

Eline's professional instincts pulled against something softer, less defended. She'd built her career on clinical distance—the notepad a physical barrier between observer and subject. But Aya's narrative architecture felt familiar in ways that unsettled her. The therapist who terminated sessions. The father who weaponized sensitivity. The careful cataloguing of abandonment.

She set her crown aside. The notepad remained closed against her ribs, but her voice gentled.

"When you notice yourself splitting—seeing someone as entirely good or entirely bad—there are grounding techniques that can help." Eline selected a fresh daisy from the pile. "The goal isn't to stop the thought. It's to recognize it as a defense, then ask what complexity you're protecting yourself from."

Aya watched Eline's hands thread the stem through the lattice.

"But what if the complexity is lie?" Her fingers stilled on her own crown. "What if someone truly is cruel, and everyone tells you to see nuance where there is none?"

"That's the clinical challenge." Eline adjusted the tension. "Distinguishing between splitting as distortion and splitting as accurate assessment of genuine harm."

"Yes." Aya's voice dropped to barely audible. "This is what I could never explain to my therapist. She would say I am catastrophizing, that I see betrayal where there is only human error. But it felt as if she was teaching me to doubt my own perception, будто my reality was symptom of illness."

The 'as if' construction landed precisely—framing her experience as filtered through doubt, a perceived attack rather than objective truth.

Eline's training recognized the pattern: traumatic transference, therapeutic rupture, the weaponization of clinical vocabulary to invalidate lived experience. Yet something about Aya's delivery felt rehearsed. The pauses landed in strategic places. The vulnerability performance peaked at exact moments.

But perhaps that assessment was unfair. Perhaps Eline's clinical gaze was precisely the dehumanizing force Aya described.

"Your reality isn't a symptom," Eline said carefully. "But trauma can make it difficult to trust your perception when you've been told repeatedly that your feelings aren't real."

Aya nodded slowly. Her fingers returned to the wilting crown, attempting to tighten the structure as Eline had demonstrated.

"My father would do this. Make me question what I saw, what I felt. He would say I am too emotional, that I create problems where none exist." The stems broke under her grip. "And then when I learned to make myself small, to trust others' judgment over my own, he called me weak. Dependent."

The golden light pressed through the barn's high windows. Paula moved between tables, her maternal performance radiating calculated warmth. At the far end, Mia braided wildflowers with aggressive precision whilst Kyle threaded daisies in mechanical rhythm, his journal resting closed beside his crown.

Eline reached for her notepad, then stopped herself. Lowered her hand.

"That's a double bind," she said quietly. "You're punished for having feelings, then punished for suppressing them. There's no way to win."

"Exactly." Aya met her gaze. "This is why I came here. Paula says Hårga teaches us to trust ourselves again, to speak our truth even when others frame it as pathology."

The therapeutic vocabulary continued—*double bind*, *trust ourselves*, *frame it as pathology*. Each phrase deployed with precision, creating a linguistic mirror that reflected Eline's own professional identity back at her.

Eline's chest tightened. She'd spent years researching coercive control, studying how high-demand groups weaponized therapeutic language to dismantle critical thinking. And here she was, drawn into exactly the pattern she'd trained to recognize.

But Aya's story resonated. The therapist who abandoned her. The father who taught her to doubt herself. The desperate search for permission to trust her own perception.

Eline's notepad remained closed against her ribs as Aya threaded another stem through her crown, this time maintaining consistent tension. The structure held.

"Thank you," Aya whispered. "For not treating me like data."

#### Chapter 4: Whispers and Observations (Day 2 at Hårga) - Scene 4

The birch forest swallowed them in waves of white bark and dappled light. Paula led the group along a narrow trail, her maternal performance extending to pointing out edible mushrooms and naming wildflowers in Swedish. Behind her, the group stretched into a loose line—some walking in pairs, others isolated by choice or circumstance.

Klaudia walked slightly ahead with Kyle, her functional boots finding purchase on roots whilst others struggled in bare feet or thin-soled slippers. She'd modified her white linen again, rolling the sleeves to free her wrists, tying the excess fabric at her waist. Practical. Operational.

Kyle's moissanite stones caught the filtered light as he walked, refracting brief prisms across the path. His journal remained in his cottage, but Klaudia knew he was cataloguing everything—the trail's markers, the spacing between participants, the acoustic properties of conversation in dense forest.

"I'm thinking Toronto might be the right move," Klaudia said, her voice carrying slightly louder than conversational volume. "The startup scene there is undervalued. Better housing costs than Amsterdam, and the immigration pathways are straightforward if you have skills."

Kyle glanced at her. His expression remained neutral, but something in his posture shifted. Recognition.

"You've researched this?" he asked, matching her volume.

"Been looking at it for months." Klaudia navigated around a fallen birch, raising her voice naturally to maintain continuity. "The tech infrastructure is solid. GlowGlitch could scale there easily—different market dynamics than Europe. Less saturated."

Behind them, perhaps twenty meters back, footsteps maintained steady rhythm. Klaudia didn't turn to check. The birdsong provided constant acoustic cover, but a careful listener would parse signal from noise.

"What about the winters?" Kyle asked, his Darth Vader resonance carrying through the trees.

"Brutal. But manageable." Klaudia stepped over exposed roots, creating natural pauses in speech. "I'd take real winter over Amsterdam's grey drizzle. At least in Toronto you get seasons. Actual darkness. Actual light. Not this perpetual in-between."

The irony of discussing darkness here, under the Midnight Sun's relentless gaze, wasn't lost on her. The golden light filtered through birch leaves, creating shifting patterns that distorted depth perception. Everything looked shadowless, over-exposed, clinical.

Paula called back from the trail's head, something about a scenic overlook ahead. Her voice carried that uncanny cadence, the Imperial Imperative disguised as gentle suggestion.

"One must experience the forest properly," Paula announced to the group. "Not rushing through, but allowing the environment to penetrate one's defenses."

Klaudia's jaw tightened. The therapeutic vocabulary weaponized again—*penetrate*, *defenses*. Everything framed as necessary invasion for healing.

Kyle's breathing remained controlled, his pace mechanical. They walked in synchronized silence for thirty seconds whilst the forest exhaled around them. Someone behind them stumbled, cursed softly. Bobi's voice, apologizing to no one.

"Toronto has better privacy laws," Klaudia continued, pitching her voice to carry without shouting. "Data protection. Corporate accountability. Less surveillance creep than most North American cities."

"You've thought this through completely," Kyle observed.

"That's what I do." Klaudia allowed herself a slight smile. "Read the fine print. Photograph the emergency exits. Plan the extraction routes."

The footsteps behind them maintained distance. Not closing, not falling back. Consistent. Attentive.

Klaudia's spiral notebook remained in her cottage beside her bed, surveillance grid half-filled with observations from the morning's wellness circle. Three cottages on the western edge. One credit card. Three names. Same booking timestamp. The registry evidence photographed and stored, waiting for the right moment to deploy.

But first, she needed to know who was listening.

The trail curved left toward Paula's scenic overlook. Klaudia navigated the turn, boots finding solid ground whilst others slipped on loose stones. She didn't look back.

The bait was set.

####

* * *

Julia walked three meters behind, alone on the trail. Her white linen moved like Parisian tailoring despite the commune's uniformity—sleeves cuffed precisely, fabric cinched at the waist with a wildflower stem she'd braided into makeshift cord. The forest pressed in from both sides, birch trunks creating vertical bars of white against golden light.

She'd heard Klaudia's voice lift on the word *Toronto*. Not shouting, not performing—just strategic projection through the trees.

Julia's eyes tracked Klaudia's modified linen, the functional boots, the deliberate stride. Then flicked forward to Paula's maternal performance at the trail's head, pointing at mushrooms like they were revelations. Back to Klaudia.

Toronto.

The city name hung in the filtered light like a question mark visible only to those watching for it.

Julia's boyfriend lived in Montreal. She'd visited twice. Knew the geography, the tech scene overlap, the immigration pathways Klaudia had mentioned with such careful specificity. Every detail Klaudia dropped was bait—accurate enough to sound organic, specific enough to trigger recognition in anyone listening with purpose rather than passive attention.

Klaudia's shoulders remained square, her pace unchanged. She didn't glance back.

But Julia caught the moment Klaudia's left hand twitched at her side—three fingers extended, then one. The gesture lasted perhaps half a second before her hand returned to neutral.

Three to one.

Three cottages. One booking.

Julia's expression didn't shift. She adjusted the wildflower cord at her waist, her movements unhurried. Let her gaze drift across the other walkers scattered along the trail behind her.

Bobi stumbled again over exposed roots, hands empty and twitching. Mia walked alone, face flushed from exertion. Eline moved at the rear, observing everyone with clinical detachment despite leaving her notepad behind.

And somewhere in the dispersed line, footsteps that had maintained consistent distance since Klaudia began her Toronto monologue.

Julia's eyes returned to Klaudia's back for exactly two seconds. A glance that acknowledged receipt without calling attention. Silent confirmation that the signal registered, the pattern recognized, the surveillance partnership intact.

Then she looked away, toward the canopy overhead where birdsong looped endlessly through golden light.

Paula announced the overlook ahead, voice carrying that rehearsed warmth. The group compressed slightly as the trail narrowed.

Julia maintained her position three meters behind Klaudia, close enough to hear, distant enough to observe who else was listening.

The bait was set.

Now they'd discover who took it.

* * *

#### Chapter 4: Whispers and Observations (Day 2 at Hårga) - Scene 6

The Longhouse at half past nine held a golden twilight that refused to deepen. Lanterns hung from the beams, their flames competing with the Midnight Sun's residual glow through high windows. The light never died here—just shifted, thinned, became something closer to exhaustion than darkness.

Bobi had commandeered the center table, cards spreading across worn wood like he was staking territory. His hands moved fast, shuffling with practised precision that looked wrong on someone who'd spent the day stumbling over roots and apologies.

"Hearts," he announced, dealing with manic efficiency. "Partners. Th-three rounds minimum."

Julia sat across from Klaudia, their silent partnership extending to card selection. Kyle occupied the end position, watching hands rather than faces. Mia had claimed the chair nearest the door, her posture suggesting she might bolt at any moment but hadn't yet.

Eline observed from the periphery, no notepad, just her clinical gaze tracking the table's dynamics.

Other retreat guests filtered in, drawn by the noise. A Swedish woman with grey-blonde hair. A younger man who'd wept during Paula's morning circle. They filled chairs around the table, creating the forced proximity the commune demanded even during recreation.

Bobi's stutter disappeared when he called plays. "Trump. Y-your lead, Julia."

She laid down a queen with surgical precision, face betraying nothing.

The room carried sound like an amphitheatre—every card snap, every inhale, every shuffle magnified by the Longhouse's acoustics. Laughter erupted when Mia took a trick she hadn't expected, the sound raw and genuine, startling in its lack of performance.

Bobi grinned, dealing another round. His white linen was already grass-stained from the afternoon's activities, bunched at his elbows where he'd pushed up the sleeves. "Best of f-five now. Come on."

Kyle played mechanically, his moissanite samples forgotten in his pocket. The game required no emotional investment, just pattern recognition and probability assessment. He won the third round without celebration.

"Again," Bobi insisted, shuffling before anyone could object.

The atmosphere loosened incrementally—shoulders dropping, voices rising, the commune's therapeutic intensity receding like low tide. For this moment, they were just people playing cards in endless light, pretending the week ahead held no teeth.

Then footsteps crossed the threshold.

Heavy boots on wood. A presence that shifted the room's temperature before anyone looked up.

* * *

The man who entered wore no white linen.

Flannel shirt, unbuttoned at the collar. Beanie pulled low over dark hair. Chest binding visible beneath the loose fabric, creating a flat masculine silhouette. Work boots that had seen actual use, not the performative kind.

He carried a beer bottle like he'd pulled it from the Longhouse kitchen, like he belonged here more than any of them.

"Room for one more?"

The voice emerged through a rasp that sounded mechanical, throat-scarred. Not quite natural but convincing enough to bypass immediate scrutiny.

Bobi froze mid-shuffle, cards suspended between his trembling hands.

Dawid crossed to the table without waiting for invitation, his gait wide and territorial. He pulled out the chair beside Julia, turned it backwards, straddled it. The movement was performance—aggressive casualness designed to claim space.

"Hearts?" He took a pull from the beer, eyes tracking Julia's face. "Good. I like games with penetration strategy."

Julia's expression went flatline. She set down her cards with deliberate care, the fork-setting stare activating.

"We're mid-round."

"Then I'll watch." Dawid leaned forward, forearms crossing the chair's back. His gaze dropped to Julia's hands, then lower, lingering with calculated intent. "Learn your tells."

Kyle's posture shifted—spine straightening, shoulders squaring. The moissanite in his pocket caught light as he reached for his water glass instead of responding.

Dawid noticed. His mouth curved.

"You the organizer?" The rasp turned the question into challenge. "Kyle, right? Saga mentioned you funded this whole field trip."

"Yes."

One word. Grey Rock protocol engaged, minimal surface for traction.

Dawid's smile widened. He took another drink, gaze sliding back to Julia like Kyle had already bored him.

"And you're the Parisian." Not a question. "Julia."

She didn't confirm, just watched him with the clinical detachment she'd use on a cockroach crossing her kitchen floor.

"Your boyfriend know you're up here playing games with strangers?" Dawid's voice dropped half an octave, intimate and invasive. "Or is this your little escape week? Get some distance, see what else is out there?"

"My relationship isn't your concern."

"Defensive." Dawid grinned at Bobi, who'd gone statue-still. "That mean I'm right?"

Klaudia's hand moved beneath the table—three fingers against her thigh where Julia could see. Warning. Observation. Log this.

Julia caught it peripherally but kept her focus on Dawid.

"You're staying in one of the western cottages."

Statement, not question. Dawid's eyebrows lifted.

"Observant. Yeah, Cottage 9. Quieter over there. Like my privacy." His attention swung back to Kyle, assessing. "Unlike some people who book group therapy disguised as vacation."

Kyle said nothing. His fingers rested motionless beside his water glass, but the tendons in his hand had gone taut.

"No comeback?" Dawid leaned back, the chair creaking under the shift in weight. "Thought tech guys were supposed to be quick. Disruptive." The word came out mocking. "Or is that just the marketing?"

Mia watched the exchange with visible tension, her flush creeping from jawline upward. She'd gone silent, hands flat on the table.

Eline hadn't moved from her position at the periphery, but her gaze had sharpened. Clinical assessment transitioning to active threat evaluation.

Dawid finished his beer in three long pulls, set the empty bottle on the table between Julia's cards and Kyle's water.

"Deal me in next round."

Bobi's hands shook so badly a card slipped from the deck, fluttering to the floor.

Nobody moved to pick it up.

* * *

#### Chapter 4: Whispers and Observations (Day 2 at Hårga) - Scene 7 (continued)

Bobi bent to retrieve the fallen card, his hand hovering three inches from the floor like the distance required negotiation.

"Leave it."

Dawid's boot settled atop the card. Flat. Final.

Bobi straightened without the card, face blotched red, and began dealing the next round with mechanical precision. His stutter manifested physically—shoulders hitching between each card distributed, hands pausing mid-air before committing to the motion.

The game resumed in silence. Julia led with the two of clubs. Klaudia followed suit. Kyle played without visible calculation, his face empty architecture.

Bobi fumbled his card, recovered, played it crooked on the pile.

Dawid watched him with the focused attention of a cat tracking a dying moth.

"You shuffle like you're apologizing to the deck."

Bobi's hands stilled. He didn't look up.

"Just trying to—" The stutter caught on the T. "—to keep things moving."

"Keep things moving." Dawid repeated it in a flat monotone, surgical mimicry. "You say that a lot, don't you? Fill the silence before anyone notices you're there."

Julia's gaze cut sideways. Klaudia's jaw tightened, but neither spoke.

Bobi dealt the next round. His hands shook harder now, cards scattering across the table instead of landing in neat stacks.

"It's fine," Bobi said to no one. "I've got it."

"You don't got it." Dawid leaned forward, elbows on the chair back, his rasp dropping into something almost gentle. More dangerous for the false intimacy. "Look at you. Performing. Organizing games nobody asked for so you can pretend you're part of something."

Bobi's throat worked. He gathered the scattered cards, tried again. One slipped from his grip, landed face-up. Queen of spades.

"You're trying so hard to be liked, it's embarrassing."

The words landed with practiced cruelty. Zero empathy, maximum impact. Dawid sat back, satisfied, and took another pull from his beer—except the bottle was empty. He'd forgotten. Set it down anyway.

Kyle's gaze tracked the motion. The forgotten beer. The performance lapse. He logged it without expression.

Bobi finished dealing. His face had gone slack, all manic energy drained. He picked up his cards but didn't organize them, just held them like evidence of failure.

"We playing or what?" Mia's voice cut sharp, her flush now spanning from collarbone to hairline.

Julia led. The round progressed in mechanical silence, each player focused on their cards with exaggerated attention. Avoiding eye contact. Avoiding Dawid.

At half past ten, Julia stood.

"I'm out."

She didn't wait for response, just gathered her cards into a neat stack and left them face-down on the table. The Longhouse door stood fifteen paces away. She crossed the distance at her usual economical pace, unhurried.

Dawid remained at the table, chair still turned backwards, watching her leave.

Julia passed close enough that the displacement of air should have carried only pine soap and retreat-issue laundry detergent.

Instead: flowers.

Faint. Almost subliminal. A synthetic floral note that didn't belong in the beeswax-and-wood atmosphere of the Longhouse. Julia had smelled it before—this afternoon at lunch, when Aya had leaned close to ask Eline a question, her oversized linen sleeve brushing Julia's arm.

The same scent.

Julia's stride didn't break. She pushed through the door into the relentless golden light, letting it close behind her with a soft thud.

Behind her, Dawid's voice continued its dissection of Bobi's shuffle technique.

Kyle sat motionless at the table, cards untouched in front of him, gaze fixed on the space where Julia had passed. His expression remained neutral, but his right hand had moved to his pocket, fingers touching the moissanite stones like a talisman.

The game continued. Bobi's hands shook. Mia's flush deepened. Klaudia logged every word in the surveillance grid she'd memorize later, unable to access her spiral notebook.

At the room's periphery, Eline finally opened her notepad. Her pen moved once, twice. A single word in precise handwriting:

*Dawid.*

Then she closed it again.

### Chapter 5: The Seeds of Doubt (Day 3 at Hårga)

#### Chapter 4: Whispers and Observations (Day 2 at Hårga) - Scene 9

The Longhouse dinner bell rang at seven—a hollow clang that echoed across the meadow, summoning bodies already exhausted from a day without shadows.

Kyle entered with the others, white linen finally replacing his travel clothes. The fabric bunched at his shoulders, refusing to drape correctly, making him look like a man wearing a costume poorly fitted.

The long tables stretched the room's length, already half-filled with guests in identical white. Servers moved between them with ceramic bowls—pale soup, pale bread, pale cheese. The food matched the aesthetic: bleached, inoffensive, uniform.

Julia claimed a seat midway down the left table, positioning herself with sight lines to both doors. Klaudia sat three spaces away. Aya occupied the opposite side, near Ingrid, her posture still hunched and apologetic.

The conversation drifted through safe topics. Weather patterns. The endless birdsong. Someone's observation about the wildflower garlands above the doorway.

Then Mia, seated at table's centre, mentioned her sister's wedding in August. The discussion shifted—gradually, naturally—to family structures, life milestones, children.

A woman with silver-streaked hair spoke warmly about her grandson's first words. Another guest described visiting her daughter's new apartment in Stockholm. The conversation acquired momentum, voices overlapping with shared experiences and gentle laughter.

Julia reached for the bread basket. Her movements unhurried, Parisian in their economy. She lifted it, extended it across the table toward Kyle.

"Have you decided about Sophie's school enrollment yet?"

The question landed with perfect casualness. Just another contribution to the family discussion. Her tone carried no emphasis, no weight. She could have been asking about weather.

Kyle's hand paused mid-reach for the basket. His face showed nothing—Grey Rock maintained—but his fingers stilled for exactly two seconds before accepting the bread.

Julia's gaze stayed on his face. But her peripheral vision tracked left, where Aya sat with a spoon halfway to her mouth.

Aya's hand didn't freeze. Didn't drop the spoon. Didn't react.

But the knuckles went white. A three-second compression, bone-sharp beneath skin, before deliberately relaxing.

The spoon continued to her mouth. She swallowed. Set the spoon down with careful precision, as if the table were glass.

Then her gaze lifted—not to Julia, but to Kyle. Searching his face for confirmation, recognition, response to a name that meant something.

Julia broke off a piece of bread. Chewed slowly.

Kyle's voice came flat, minimal. "No children."

"Oh." Julia's eyebrows lifted in manufactured surprise. "My mistake."

She returned to her soup. Across the table, Aya's breathing had gone shallow, almost imperceptible.

Klaudia watched both women without turning her head.

* * *

As Aya extended her hand for a bread roll, there was the briefest hesitation—a flicker more than a pause. Her fingers trembled, not visibly to most, but enough to vibrate through the stillness of her reach. The tremor was brief, contained swiftly, as if by sheer force of will. Yet it resonated, carrying a ripple of vulnerability that disturbed the surface of her controlled facade.

Julia, vigilant and poised, captured the moment in her mental ledger, adding it to her growing collection of observations about Aya. This was the kind of detail she lived for—the unnoticed quiver that revealed the story behind the blank canvas. She tucked it away, another small piece in a larger puzzle she was quietly assembling.

Aya's gaze shifted from Kyle, redirecting smoothly, her composure restored as though it had never wavered. She clutched the bread roll gently, fingers curling around its soft crust. The dinner conversation resumed its natural flow, unbroken by the brief disruption.

Across the table, Kyle remained an unmoved sentinel, his presence solid yet echoing with absence. As if perched on the brink of a deeper understanding that continued to elude him, left out of view in the unyielding daylight of the Midnight Sun.

* * *

Mia sat nearby, swirling the lukewarm remnants of her soup. Her ears pricked at the mention of "Sophie," and she was no longer just a spectator of the conversation. Her gaze flicked to Kyle, noting his composed, yet diffident demeanor—a standard feature of his interactions. Another layer of detachment in a scene pulled impossibly taut by unspoken histories and inferred narratives.

The name Sophie tumbled within her, unsettling thoughts like pebbles in a glass jar. Here was another crack in Kyle's persona, the polished veneer concealing a fissure she suspected all along. Anger flared, and incertitude gnawed at her. She couldn't shake the notion—perhaps his fractures ran deeper than mere emotional calculation.

Aya cowered slightly across the table, or so it seemed. Her sympathetic glance toward Mia was heavy with shared knowledge, an unspoken alliance. There was a whisper of conspiracy in Aya's meticulously crafted vulnerability. Mia momentarily connected to her, finding an unexpected camaraderie in that silent exchange. Their eyes locked, and for the first time, Mia felt an understanding pass between them—not the professed transparency of the retreat, but something far more raw and unsettling.

Kyle, the vigil-like architect at the table's far edge, continued eating, untouched by the undercurrents swirling around him. To Mia, his lack of acknowledgment reflected culpability—a tacit admission wrapped in his habitual reticence. It rankled her deeply, flashing back through all previous exchanges—his half-smiles, the way he rationalized emotional disconnects as mere data blips. Could it all be part of a calculated facade?

She returned her attention to Aya, who remained expressionless yet an island of control amid the collective churn. When Aya glanced up, offering a fleeting, reassuring smile, it appeared to Mia as not just support, but the silent acknowledgment of an accomplice.

Bobi dropped his spoon in the ensuing pause, the clang exaggerated in the echoing acoustics of the Longhouse. Heads turned, drawn by the disruption, leaving behind whispered suspicions like discarded shadows beneath the burning light.

Mia returned to her dinner, letting the silence sink in—an accomplice now, with eyes anew towards Kyle. Fuelled by new doubts, the kindling of past resentments fed a fire already sparking within her. Here, under the unwavering daylight, the scene lay open, all raw nerves and jarring questions unlit by the comforting shadows of ignorance.

* * *

Across the table, Klaudia’s eyes found Julia’s. It was a practiced routine now, a silent dialogue honed over shared glances and nearly telepathic exchanges. Julia inclined her head almost imperceptibly—the bait had been set and taken. 

Kyle's nonchalance amidst the tension confirmed their suspicions: her mention of Sophie had succeeded in unearthing the fracture lines within the group's unspoken agreements. Klaudia felt an electric thrill at the meticulous unfolding of their plan. The precision of their pincer movement had been wordless, elegant in its execution.

The white linen tablecloth separated them like a canvas of the unspoken, each player silently assigned their role. Klaudia noted how Julia's fingers danced over her glass, a signal of readiness, an acknowledgment of the shifting dynamics now tilting in subtle revolt.

Outside, the unending light persisted, indifferent to these human machinations. Beneath it, the table’s occupants were locked in a private ballet of intrigue and subterfuge, visible yet obscure under the relentless gaze of the sun. Klaudia, with her practical boots planted firmly, felt the structure of their investigation gaining momentum with each porcelain clang—a quiet symphony orchestrating around Kyle, the unknowing center of this widening rift.

* * *

Kyle's gaze swept the table with forensic detachment, cataloguing the micro-adjustments in posture and tone. Mia's grip on her spoon had tightened. Aya's breathing pattern had shifted—shallow, controlled. Julia's question about Sophie had registered as noise, data without context.

He noted the exchange of glances between Klaudia and Julia. A coordination pattern, perhaps discussing logistics for tomorrow's hike. The kind of silent communication people developed after years of friendship.

The moissanite stones in his pocket pressed against his thigh. He resisted the urge to touch them, maintaining his stillness at the table's end. Around him, conversation resumed—weather observations, questions about the afternoon's weaving session, someone requesting more bread.

Aya's knuckles had returned to their normal colour. Mia reached for her water glass with deliberate calm. The data points accumulated in Kyle's mental grid, awaiting pattern recognition that wouldn't come.

He filed the moment under "social friction"—predictable turbulence in forced proximity. The white linen uniforms blurred individual markers, making it harder to track who reacted to what. Outside the window, the Maypole stood motionless in the meadow, casting no shadow.

Kyle reached for his bread roll, already thinking ahead to tonight's journal entry.

* * *

The river's icy grip tightened around Bobi as he stood waist-deep in shimmering darkness. His teeth clattered an uneven rhythm while his skin erupted in goosebumps. Each shallow breath sent icy tendrils deeper into his chest.

"Think of this as a renewal," Saga's voice carried over the water, calm and steady. Her presence, though less maternal than Paula's, radiated a soft authority.

Bobi attempted a smile, but his expression faltered with each shiver. "Renewal, r-right."

Aya stood at the bank, shadowed by the treeline's looming embrace. Her gaze anchored on Bobi, eyes shifting with the river's dance. "You uncomfortable , будто it like childhood cold bath?" Her voice was soft, almost swallowed by the river's whisper.

Bobi nodded, his laugh merging with the ripple of water. "Feels a bit like a freezer," he managed.

Saga watched them, clipboard absent. "The water takes what we need to release," she explained, glancing at Aya who nodded softly in agreement. "And afterward, you'll feel what remains is purer."

Aya had inched forward, the floral scent clinging to the air between them. "Nature suits you, Bobi," she encouraged, grasping the edge of a nearby rock. "You belong with it."

Saga turned her gaze to Bobi, holding his attention with a gentle firmness. "Remember, this experience is about letting go of what doesn't serve us."

Bobi, enveloped by their words, found his breath calming despite the cold. A bridge between them built on shared vulnerability. He tried to move, the water thick as syrup around his legs.

Aya flicked her hair back, dark and unbound. "Why you hesitate?"

Bobi's fingers combed the water. "I'm just... It's cold, you know? Gets to the bones."

Saga stepped closer from the riverbank, her presence a gentle guide. "Sometimes, we must embrace discomfort to find true change."

Aya's smile shifted Bobi's focus. "You brave. Strong. This no defeat."

Bobi's laughter cut through the ritual, unexpected and honest. It folded outward into the cold air, unfurling warmth between shivers. "I guess I'm here now, right?"

Saga nodded, a hint of amusement in her eyes. "Precisely where you're meant to be."

Aya settled beside the water, closer now. "Together, we're less alone."

The river's currents whispered promises that only the initiated could hear. Bobi found that choice in the solidity of companionship, in Aya's seemingly fragile strength—woven like myth across the communal embrace.

Saga’s voice, no longer a mere guide, now bore witness to what unfurled—a bond sealed in cold water, an alignment beneath the relentless Northern Sky.

* * *

#### Chapter 5: The Seeds of Doubt (Day 3 at Hårga) - Scene 6 (continued)

Aya stepped into the river, her white linen darkening as it absorbed the cold water. She moved with fluid grace, each step deliberate, serene—as though the temperature held no dominion over her. The water rose to her waist, matching Bobi's depth, and she positioned herself beside him.

"You feel it?" Her voice emerged barely above a murmur, hypnotic against the river's constant whisper. "How the cold makes everything sharp, clear?"

Bobi nodded, teeth still chattering. His hands floated uselessly at the water's surface.

Aya's gaze drifted downstream, following the current toward darkness. "I was like you once. Wanting to belong so badly it hurt." She paused, her fingers trailing patterns in the water. "There was someone I trusted completely. Someone who made me feel seen."

"Who?" Bobi's stutter vanished, replaced by genuine curiosity.

"His name was Thomas Kim." The name dropped like a stone into still water. "He was brilliant. Everyone said so. He had this way of making you feel special, like you were the only person in the room who understood him."

Bobi shifted closer, drawn by the intimacy of confession. The cold receded slightly, replaced by the warmth of shared secrets.

"We worked together in Toronto." Aya's voice remained soft, each word carefully placed. "He recruited me for his startup. Said my perspective was exactly what they needed. At first, it felt будто a dream—he valued my ideas, included me in every decision."

The river current tugged at their legs, gentle but persistent.

"What happened?" Bobi's hands stilled.

Aya's expression fractured—vulnerability bleeding through practiced composure. "He used me. Every idea I shared, he took credit for. Every late night I stayed working, he framed as me being unable to keep up during normal hours." Her breathing grew shallow. "When I finally confronted him, he looked at me with this... emptiness. Like I was data. A resource that had stopped providing value."

Bobi's chest tightened, recognition sparking somewhere deep. "That sounds—"

"Cruel?" Aya finished. "It was. But the worst part was how he did it. He never raised his voice. Never lost his composure. Just treated my pain like a system error he needed to debug." Her gaze fixed on Bobi. "He had this way of making you feel like your emotions were a malfunction. That if you just thought more logically, you'd understand why what he did was reasonable."

The comparison hung unspoken but unmistakable.

Saga remained on the bank, watching but not intervening. The ritual's boundaries expanded to accommodate confession.

"Thomas would catalogue everything," Aya continued, her voice dropping lower. "He kept journals. Observations about how people responded to different approaches. He'd test theories on us without consent, treating the entire team as his personal psychology experiment."

Bobi's breath caught. The description resonated with something he couldn't quite name.

"When I left, he sent me a spreadsheet." Aya's laugh emerged hollow. "An actual spreadsheet. Quantifying my contributions versus compensation received, proving mathematically why I had no grounds for complaint."

The river's cold pressed in again, sharp and unforgiving.

"I'm sorry," Bobi whispered. "That's—I don't even know what to say."

Aya turned to face him fully, her expression open and raw. "The hardest part is knowing he'll do it again. That somewhere, there's another person who thinks they've found someone who finally understands them." Her hand found Bobi's forearm beneath the water. "And he'll use them the same way he used me. Thomas , he no care about damage. Only about being right."

The auxiliary verb dropped away naturally, her vulnerability manifesting in fractured grammar.

Bobi's mind churned, drawing parallels he didn't want to acknowledge.

"Sometimes I wonder if people like that even know they're cruel," Aya continued, her grip tightening slightly. "Or if they've convinced themselves that logic is more important than hurt."

* * *

Bobi stood motionless in the water, Aya's words settling into his chest like stones. The cold had become irrelevant—background noise to the warmth of being seen, understood, included in something that mattered.

"You get it," he said, the words tumbling out without his usual careful filtering. "What it's like when someone makes you feel small."

Aya's hand remained on his forearm, her touch anchoring him against the current. "Yes."

"I've been trying so hard." Bobi's voice cracked. "To be useful. To prove I deserve to be here." His gaze drifted toward the bank, where Saga watched with patient approval. "But nothing I do feels like enough."

"Because you're performing for an audience that doesn't value you," Aya said gently. "I did the same thing with Thomas. Exhausted myself trying to earn recognition from someone fundamentally incapable of giving it."

The comparison solidified in Bobi's mind, sharp and terrible. He thought of Kyle's systematic card victories, the way he'd funded the entire retreat without asking anyone's input, the spreadsheet logic applied to human connection.

"Some people," Aya continued, her voice barely audible above the water's whisper, "treat relationships like transactions. They catalogue responses, measure emotional labour, quantify worth." She paused. "But you deserve better than being someone's data point."

Bobi's throat tightened. The validation hit like oxygen after drowning.

"Here," Aya gestured to the retreat beyond the trees, "people see you. Not what you can provide. Not how well you perform. Just you."

"Really?" The word emerged small, hopeful.

"Really." Aya squeezed his arm once before releasing. "That's why I came. To find people who understand that vulnerability isn't weakness. That needing others isn't a flaw to be optimized away."

Bobi nodded, something fundamental shifting beneath his ribs. For the first time since arriving, he felt the possibility of belonging without performance, acceptance without conditions.

He didn't notice how Aya's breathing had steadied, how her trembling hands had gone still. Didn't register the calculated timing of her confession, the way she'd positioned herself between him and the bank—between him and escape.

All Bobi felt was warmth spreading through his chest, displacing the cold. Connection. Understanding.

Finally, someone who saw him.

* * *

#### Chapter 5: The Seeds of Doubt (Day 3 at Hårga) - Scene 9

Mia stood on the riverbank, arms crossed against the chill that never quite penetrated the relentless light. She watched Bobi emerge from the water, transformed—shoulders straighter, face open in a way she hadn't seen since Rotterdam.

Whatever Aya had said to him worked.

Mia's jaw tightened as fragments of conversation drifted across the current. Thomas Kim. Toronto. Logic as cruelty.

The parallels carved themselves into her thoughts without invitation. Kyle's spreadsheet to Eline. His clinical dissection of Mia's "emotional intensity" as a variable requiring management. The way he treated human pain like debugging code.

Aya climbed out of the water, white linen clinging to her frame. She wrapped herself in the blanket Saga offered, movements slow and deliberate. Fragile. Real.

Not performing radical transparency. Just living it.

Mia uncrossed her arms, something fierce and protective rising in her chest. Here was someone who understood that caring deeply wasn't pathology. That righteous anger served a purpose.

That some people weaponized logic to justify cruelty.

Aya's gaze found Mia across the clearing—brief, searching. No words passed between them.

None needed to.

#### Chapter 5: The Seeds of Doubt (Day 3 at Hårga) - Scene 10

The Workshop Barn smelled of sap and crushed wildflowers. Mia sat at the far end of the long table, fingers working stems into submission. Daisies, clover, buttercups—all braided tight enough to bruise.

Saga moved between workstations, her voice soft as she encouraged a middle-aged woman struggling with a delicate crown. Others worked in companionable silence, their white linen sleeves rolled back, hands moving with meditative calm.

Mia's crown grew larger with each aggressive twist. The stems bent where they should curve, leaves tearing under the pressure of her grip.

Aya sat three seats down, across from Klaudia. Her fingers moved slowly, pausing every few moments as if uncertain which flower came next. She held a stem up to the light, examining it with childlike wonder.

Mia watched those uncertain hands and felt her chest tighten.

Thomas Kim kept journals. Catalogued people's responses.

Kyle kept a leather journal in his pocket. Always watching. Always recording.

Thomas sent spreadsheets to justify cruelty.

Kyle sent spreadsheets to quantify conflict of interest.

Thomas treated emotions like malfunctions.

Kyle called her intensity "data requiring management."

Mia yanked a buttercup stem hard enough to snap it. The flower head tumbled onto the table.

"Careful," Saga said, pausing beside her. "The stems bruise easily if you force them."

Mia set the ruined crown down, her knuckles white against the wood. Across the table, Aya's fingers trembled as she wove a purple wildflower into her crown. The movement looked genuine—not performed vulnerability, but actual struggle.

Not someone playing victim.

Someone who *was* one.

Klaudia glanced between them, her expression unreadable. She reached for fresh stems without speaking.

Mia picked up her crown again, forcing herself to slow. To breathe. To braid instead of strangle.

But the parallels wouldn't dissolve.

Toronto. Rotterdam. Spreadsheets. Journals. Men who treated people like experiments.

Aya looked up, met Mia's gaze for half a second. Something passed between them—recognition, alliance, understanding.

Then Aya returned to her crown, fingers still trembling.

Mia braided another stem into place.

Saga moved on to help someone else.

The barn fell back into silence, broken only by the endless birdsong filtering through the windows and the quiet sound of stems being twisted into submission.

####

#### Chapter 5: The Seeds of Doubt (Day 3 at Hårga) - Scene 11

Aya set her half-finished crown down and moved around the table. She slid onto the bench beside Mia, her oversized white linen bunching at her shoulders.

"May I sit?"

Mia nodded, not trusting her voice.

Aya picked up fresh stems from the communal pile, her movements slow and deliberate. For a while, neither spoke. The barn's acoustics amplified every sound—stems snapping, cloth rustling, Saga's gentle encouragement at the far end.

"You are angry," Aya said quietly. Not a question.

Mia's fingers tightened around her crown. "I'm fine."

"Is not same thing." Aya paused, selecting a white daisy. "Being fine and not being angry."

Mia exhaled hard through her nose. Across the barn, Klaudia watched them without appearing to watch, her hands weaving steadily.

"Thomas used to say that to me," Aya continued, threading the daisy into her crown with trembling precision. "That I was too sensitive. That my reactions were… disproportionate to data." She pronounced the last word carefully, as if it hurt her mouth. "He would write things in his journal. My face when he criticized. How long before I apologized. He called it pattern recognition."

Mia's hands went still.

"He liked when I cried," Aya whispered. "Not because he cared. Because it confirmed his hypothesis. That I was, будто, emotionally unstable. A liability."

The birdsong loop outside continued its relentless cycle. Mia's throat felt tight.

"Men like that…" Aya set down her crown, fingers lacing together. "They make you feel crazy for having feelings. For wanting connection that is not transactional. They treat kindness like weakness. Vulnerability like malfunction."

She glanced toward the open barn door, where golden light poured across the meadow. Kyle stood near the Maypole, motionless, his white linen pristine despite the grass. His hands rested at his sides. Observing. Recording.

"They watch us," Aya continued. "Always watching. Writing down what we say, how we react. Building cases against our humanity."

Mia followed her gaze. Kyle's stillness looked wrong in the perpetual daylight—too composed, too controlled, like a statue positioned to surveil.

"He no see you," Aya said softly. "He sees data. Problem requiring solution."

Mia's knuckles turned white around the flower stems.

"And when you break…" Aya's voice cracked. "He will write it down. Prove you were always broken. That he was right to treat you like experiment."

The crown in Mia's hands bent under the pressure. Petals scattered across the table.

Saga called for everyone to gather for the afternoon circle.

Aya stood, collecting her unfinished crown. She touched Mia's shoulder briefly—a gesture of solidarity, of shared understanding.

Then she walked away, leaving Mia alone with her rage and the scattered evidence of flowers destroyed.

* * *

#### Chapter 5: The Seeds of Doubt (Day 3 at Hårga) - Scene 12

Saga arranged the group in a loose circle on woven mats in the meadow, the Maypole casting no shadow in the relentless light. The afternoon session focused on "shared testimony"—an invitation to speak truth without judgment.

Mia sat cross-legged, her white linen bunched at her knees, grass-stained from the morning's weaving. The flush crept from her jawline upward, spreading across her cheeks in blotchy patches. Her breathing had gone shallow.

Dog Brain, Eline would have called it. Mia called it clarity.

Across the circle, Kyle sat with architectural posture, his leather journal resting closed on his lap. His hands remained still. Composed. Always composed.

Aya settled two spaces to Mia's left, her oversized linen swallowing her frame. She kept her eyes downcast, fingers worrying the hem of her sleeve.

Saga spoke in her measured, soothing tone. "The practice of vulnerability requires us to bring forward what we've kept hidden. Not for shame, but for release. Who would like to begin?"

Silence stretched. The birdsong loop continued its manic cheerfulness.

Bobi cleared his throat, then said nothing. His hands twisted in his lap.

"I will," Mia heard herself say.

The words came out raw, her voice textured with something between rage and grief. Kyle's gaze shifted to her—clinical, observational. Recording.

"I've been told my whole life that my feelings are too much." Mia's hands clenched against her thighs. "That I need to manage my intensity. Calibrate my responses. Treat my emotions like bugs in code that need debugging."

Julia's fork-setting stare locked onto Mia from across the circle. Klaudia's fingers stilled on her spiral notebook.

"And I believed it," Mia continued, the flush deepening. "I thought something was wrong with me. That caring deeply was pathological. That wanting honest connection instead of transactional exchanges made me fundamentally broken."

Saga nodded encouragement. "What changed?"

Mia's gaze found Aya, who met her eyes with perfect understanding—two people who'd been made small by men who weaponized logic.

"I realized some people use logic to justify cruelty." Mia's voice gained strength. "They document your pain to prove you're unstable. They treat vulnerability like data points in an experiment you never consented to."

Kyle's expression remained neutral. He didn't reach for his journal, but his fingers twitched toward it—a tell Mia had learned to recognize.

"They make you doubt your own perception," Mia said. "Gaslight you into thinking your emotional intelligence is emotional dysfunction. And when you finally break under the weight of being treated like a malfunction instead of a human being…"

Her breath came ragged now.

"They write it down. Proof they were right all along."

Aya's hand moved to her chest—a gesture of shared trauma, of recognition.

Saga spoke gently. "Thank you for your honesty, Mia. That took courage."

But Mia wasn't finished. The rage had found its target, and the commune's philosophy gave her permission to name it.

"Thomas Kim did that to Aya," she said, her voice carrying across the circle. "Used her brilliance, took credit for her work, then documented her pain as evidence of instability. Made her feel crazy for wanting reciprocity instead of exploitation."

Kyle's jaw tightened—barely perceptible, but Mia caught it.

"Men like that…" Mia's hands unclenched, then reclenched harder. "They don't see people. They see systems to optimize. Problems to solve. And when the problem is a human being who refuses to be reduced to data…"

Aya's shoulders shook. Genuine tears, or performance—Mia couldn't tell, didn't care. What mattered was the truth between them: they'd both been measured and found wanting by men who mistook coldness for intelligence.

"Radical transparency means calling it what it is," Mia finished. "Not burnout. Not stress. Cruelty. Dressed up in spreadsheets and logic."

Silence.

Kyle sat motionless, the moissanite stones invisible in his pocket. His composure held, but something shifted in the space around him—the group's collective gaze, newly weaponized.

Saga thanked Mia again, then invited others to share.

But Mia had already won. Aya's mythology had found fertile ground in Mia's righteous anger, and together they'd planted seeds that would grow into something Kyle's logic couldn't debug.

Two warriors against perceived injustice, bound by shared conviction and the blinding brightness of the Midnight Sun.

* * *

Klaudia sat three positions to Kyle's right, her spiral notebook balanced on her knee. The surveillance grid she'd been maintaining—tracking who spoke to whom, when, for how long—gained a new entry.

**15:47 – Maypole Meadow – Mia public testimony re: Thomas Kim mythology. Aya present, visible emotional response. Group dynamic shift observable.**

Her pen paused.

Mia's transformation had been too complete, too sudden. Three days ago, Mia's anger had scattered like buckshot—unfocused rage at Kyle's composure, at Eline's clinical distance, at the retreat itself. Now that fury had crystallized into something surgical. Targeted.

Klaudia watched Mia's flushed face, the rawness in her voice as she defended someone she'd barely spoken to before yesterday's river ritual. Bobi had emerged from that water changed—trembling allegiance replacing his manic energy. Now Mia spoke with the conviction of a convert, weaponizing the commune's philosophy with frightening precision.

Aya sat small and hunched, tears tracking down her cheeks. Perfect victim positioning. But Klaudia had seen the guest registry—three cottages, one credit card, April twenty-third. Two months before Kyle finalized their booking.

Nothing about Aya's presence was spontaneous.

Klaudia added another line to her notebook: **Mia + Aya alliance formed post-craft session. Recruit pattern consistent with Bobi (river). Methodology: vulnerability exploitation.**

Across the circle, Kyle remained motionless. His composure invited prosecution—every second of his stillness read as guilt by a group primed to see cruelty in control.

Saga invited others to share. Julia's gaze tracked from Mia to Aya to Kyle, cataloguing the shifting dynamics with surgical attention.

Klaudia closed her notebook. The unease in her chest wasn't fear—not yet. But the pattern recognition that made her excellent at logistics now screamed warnings her forensic mind couldn't ignore.

Something had been set in motion. And Mia had just become its most enthusiastic participant.

### Chapter 6: The Script is Read (Day 4 at Hårga)

The Longhouse felt different.

Dinner arrived at the usual hour—pale soup, dark bread, roasted vegetables that tasted of earth and ash. The servers moved through their choreography, setting bowls with practised silence. But the forced conviviality that usually filled the space, the performance of communal warmth, had curdled into something heavier.

Mia sat at the table's centre, her white linen pristine despite the day's activities. Her flower crown sat crooked on her head, wildflowers braided with aggressive precision. She ate mechanically, her jaw working the bread with visible tension.

Kyle occupied his usual position across from Eline. His moissanite stones pressed against his thigh through his pocket, a tactile anchor he refused to touch. His soup grew cold.

Bobi sat three seats down from Mia, his hands never empty. He'd brought his carved wooden figure to dinner, turning it over and over between his fingers. His stutter had vanished in the meadow when he'd spoken in Aya's defence—brief, trembling words about people who made you feel small. Now his silence felt different. Deliberate.

Aya ate at the far table, hunched small between two facilitators. She'd claimed nausea, apologizing for her presence, but Ingrid had insisted she needed nourishment. Aya's fingers trembled as she broke her bread into smaller and smaller pieces.

The birdsong loop continued outside, relentless.

Julia watched Mia from her position beside Klaudia. Something coiled in Mia's posture—the flush creeping up from her jawline, the rigid control in her spine. Dog Brain state, building pressure.

Then Mia stood.

The scrape of her chair against the floor cut through the ambient noise. Conversations died. Twenty faces turned toward her.

Mia's breathing came ragged, her chest rising and falling beneath the white linen. Her knuckles had gone white gripping the table's edge.

The Midnight Sun poured through the windows, over-exposing everything. No shadows. No mercy.

Mia's voice, when it came, carried the raw texture of someone past control.

"We need to talk about what's happening here."

* * *

The silence expanded, visceral. 

Mia's hand moved to her pocket. She withdrew a folded piece of paper—bright white, not the recycled cream stock of the commune's handouts. Her fingers trembled against it.

Kyle's gaze fixed on the paper. Not Mia's face. The paper.

"I know your secrets now , Kyle."

The words came rough, scraped raw from Mia's throat. She held the paper like evidence, like a weapon forged in fire. Her flush had spread from jawline to forehead, sweat beading at her temples despite the cool evening air flowing through the open windows.

"Thomas Kim trusted you." Mia's voice broke on the name, authentic pain bleeding through. "He gave you everything. His ideas. His work. His *belief* that you saw him as more than just—"

She glanced down at the paper, her lips moving silently before continuing.

"—more than just exploitable labour. And you documented it. You catalogued his vulnerabilities like test subjects. You turned his trust into data points."

Julia leaned forward fractionally. Klaudia's pen had stopped moving over her notebook.

Mia's breathing grew more ragged. "You kept journals. Tracking responses. Running experiments on people who thought they were your *friends*." The word twisted with contempt. "When Thomas finally confronted you about taking credit for his work, you sent him a spreadsheet. A fucking *spreadsheet* quantifying his contributions to prove he had no grounds for complaint."

Aya sat motionless at the far table, her bread forgotten. Tears tracked down her face.

Kyle remained absolutely still. His hand had moved to his pocket—a micro-movement—before freezing. The moissanite stones.

"You made him feel crazy for wanting reciprocity," Mia continued, voice climbing. "You treated his pain like a malfunction. You gaslighted him into believing his emotions were pathological, that caring *deeply* about people was a weakness you needed to debug."

The paper shook in Mia's grip.

"And now you've brought us here. To this place. This *retreat*." She spat the word. "Radical transparency. But only for everyone else. Only so you can watch us break and take more notes."

Mia's chest heaved. The Dog Brain state had consumed her completely—flushed, ragged, righteous.

"Someone needed to say it."

The paper crumpled slightly in her fist as she finally met Kyle's eyes.

* * *

Kyle sat at the table's end, still as a statue. His eyes tracked Mia's every movement, focusing on that damning piece of paper clenched in her hand. She had no idea the secret it held—perhaps the most significant clue of all.

A space gap before every comma—a glitch too consistent to be dismissed as carelessness. It echoed the inconsistency he'd noted in the morning schedule and in other fragments he'd collected over the past few days. Another piece of the puzzle to log in his memory.

Mia's accusations echoed in the Longhouse, building a tense anticipation that clung to everyone present. Bobi shifted uncomfortably; his carved wooden figure slipped slightly from his grasp. Eline's eyes darted between Mia and Kyle, her clinical facade slipping as her unease grew palpable.

"You think you're so clever, don't you?" Mia continued, her voice a mix of defiance and raw vulnerability. "Treating everyone here like we're just components in your machine. But we're not your calculations to catalogue!"

Kyle's face remained impassive. His silence felt heavy —a calculated response. The Grey Rock protocol that once served him in boardroom battles and high-pressure negotiations had become his armour here. Logic over emotion, observation over reaction. He knew engaging in Mia's emotional storm would only fuel it.

Julia, at Klaudia's side, assessed Kyle with piercing precision, dark eyes searching his composure for cracks. She'd always been the one to slice through flimsy defences with surgical questions. Yet now, she remained silent, a witness.

Mia's breathing slowed slightly, her flush deepening. Her chest rose and fell like a wave struggling to find shore. The silence stretched, expectant.

Finally, Aya's voice broke it from across the room, quiet yet firm. "You , know this isn't just Kyle here. This affects everyone. We're all part of it."

The attention shifted momentarily. Aya's words hung in the air, laden with implications beyond the commune's doctrine of radical transparency. Her gaze didn't leave Kyle, her eyes both vulnerable and calculating.

Their silent exchange—Kyle's steady scrutiny against Aya's enigmatic vulnerability—weighted the air between them. His stillness a challenge, her presence a mystery yet to be unwound.

Kyle noted the shifting alliances, the tensions threading between them. The space-between-comma glitch etched into his mind an artifact of deception, syncing with a mental rhythm leading him closer to the truth.

* * *

#### Chapter 6: The Script is Read (Day 4 at Hårga) - Scene 4

The silence after Aya's intervention fractured into scattered murmurs. Guests shifted in their seats, the scrape of wood against wood punctuating the discomfort rippling through the Longhouse. Some leant back, shoulders hunching as though distance might shield them from Mia's raw intensity. Others stared at their laps, white linen pooling around folded hands.

Across from Kyle, Eline's jaw tightened. She'd closed her notepad sometime during Mia's speech, fingers pressed flat against the cover as if to keep something contained. Her clinical observation had limits, and this room had exceeded them.

Bobi's carved figure clattered to the table. He didn't retrieve it, just watched it roll towards the edge and stop. His hands stayed empty, twitching.

Julia's fork lowered slowly. She set it down with deliberate precision, never breaking eye contact with Kyle. No words. Just the weight of assessment.

At the far table, Saga rose. Not quickly—nothing here moved quickly except accusations—but with the calm authority of someone stepping into familiar choreography. She crossed to Mia, bare feet silent on the wooden floor, and placed a hand on Mia's trembling shoulder.

"Thank you for bringing this into the light." Saga's voice carried through the hall, warm and affirming. "This is the work. This honesty, this courage to name what has been hidden."

Mia's breath hitched. The validation landed like absolution, her rigid posture softening incrementally under Saga's touch.

"Secrets fester in darkness," Saga continued, addressing the room now. "What Mia has done—bringing her truth forward, refusing to protect anyone from necessary discomfort—this is healing."

A few guests nodded. One woman at the middle table murmured agreement, her flower crown slipping forward as she leant towards her neighbour in conspiratorial validation.

Kyle's fingers found the moissanite stones in his pocket. Cold. Sharp-edged. He didn't squeeze them, just let their presence anchor him whilst Saga performed her ritual of affirmation.

"The retreat honours your bravery, Mia." Saga's maternal tone thickened. "You've shown us all what radical transparency truly means."

Aya watched from her seat, bread crumbs scattered before her untouched soup. Her trembling had stopped. Her eyes tracked between Saga and Mia, then settled on Kyle with something almost imperceptible in their depths—not quite satisfaction, but close.

Klaudia's hand moved beneath the table, fingers tapping a rhythm against her thigh. Julia caught it. One-two-three. One.

Three cottages. One booking.

* * *

Julia's eyes found Klaudia's across the table. No need for signals now. The recognition passed between them instantaneous, complete.

Orchestrated.

Every beat of Mia's speech had landed with precision. The pauses. The accusations escalating in rhythm. The paper clutched in Mia's fist—white, not cream—containing accusations Mia hadn't lived through, couldn't have witnessed, about a person who might not exist.

Thomas Kim.

Toronto.

Klaudia's jaw set. Her fingers stopped tapping. Three cottages, one booking, and now this: Mia weaponized, her anger given scripture to recite. The craft session whispers. The river ritual. Aya positioning herself between vulnerable targets and the light, filling their heads with mythology whilst the Midnight Sun watched.

Julia's fork remained beside her plate, abandoned. She tracked Saga's hand on Mia's shoulder, the performative validation radiating through the room like staged catharsis. This wasn't spontaneous confession. This was theatre. And Mia—flushed, righteous, trembling with the satisfaction of finally being heard—had no idea she was reading someone else's lines.

The pincer movement they'd planned—Julia's bait, Klaudia's evidence, converging to expose the anomaly—had turned against them. Aya had anticipated investigators. She'd recruited faster. Moved through the group like infection, finding the rawest wounds and filling them with her script.

Klaudia's gaze shifted to Aya. Still seated. Still performing fragility, bread crumbs like scattered evidence of her distress. But her breathing was controlled now. Her knuckles no longer white. And when Aya met Klaudia's stare, something flickered there—brief, cold, gone.

Recognition of recognition.

Julia felt the board tilt. They'd underestimated the speed of conversion. Mia wasn't an ally anymore. She was artillery. And Bobi, silent three seats away, wouldn't meet anyone's eyes. The river had claimed him too.

Saga stepped back from Mia, addressing the room again. "This is why we gather. To witness each other's truth without judgment."

Without judgment. As if Mia's testimony wasn't condemnation. As if the room's energy hadn't shifted, dividing cleanly between those who heard manipulation and those who heard gospel.

Klaudia's hand found her notebook beneath the table. Julia watched her grip it tight.

The pincer was executing. Just not theirs.

* * *

#### Chapter 6: The Script is Read (Day 4 at Hårga) - Scene 6

Morning light pressed down on the Maypole Meadow like an interrogator's lamp. No shadows. No escape from visibility. Paula stood at the circle's centre, arms raised in rehearsed benediction, white shawl draped over white linen, reading glasses catching the sun.

"We breathe together," Paula intoned, that uncanny maternal cadence. "One does not heal alone."

Julia stepped forward. The circle broke.

"Who is Thomas Kim?"

Paula's hands lowered. The maternal mask held, but something beneath it recalculated. "I beg your pardon?"

"Thomas Kim." Julia's voice carried surgical precision across the meadow. "The man Mia spoke about last night. The startup. Toronto. The journals, the spreadsheets, the emotional abuse." She paused. "Which retreat guest actually worked with him?"

The circle shifted. Feet in grass. Bodies angling toward the confrontation.

Paula smiled—warm, reassuring, utterly wrong. "One must respect the privacy of those who share their pain."

"That's not an answer."

"You must reflect, Julia, on why transparency feels threatening to you."

The Imperial Imperative. You must. One does not. Julia heard it land, felt the weight of commune ideology being deployed against her question. Around the circle, heads nodded. Aya watched from her position between two facilitators, hands folded, face tilted down in practiced submission.

"I'm not asking for private details." Julia held Paula's gaze. "I'm asking for verifiable facts. Who worked with Thomas Kim? Which company? What city, specifically, in Toronto?"

Paula's smile didn't waver. "The specifics matter less than the emotional truth."

"The specifics are the only thing that matters."

Klaudia stood motionless at Julia's left flank, notebook forgotten. Across the circle, Mia's jaw set, flushed from jawline up. Bobi stared at the trampled grass. Kyle remained at the circle's edge, touching the moissanite stones in his pocket, cataloguing Paula's micro-expressions.

Paula spread her arms again, reclaiming the circle's geometry. "We do not interrogate here, Julia. We witness. We hold space."

"You're holding nothing but air."

The meadow fell silent. Even the birdsong seemed to pause, that endless loop skipping a beat. Paula's reading glasses caught the light, obscuring her eyes. Her smile remained fixed, maternal, utterly controlled.

"Perhaps you need time to sit with your resistance," Paula said softly. "One does not heal through combat."

Julia didn't move. The sun bore down. Nowhere to hide.

####

* * *

#### Chapter 6: The Script is Read (Day 4 at Hårga) - Scene 6 (continued)

"Where did this commune come from?" Julia's voice cut through the meadow like steel. "Who founded it? When? What's the legal structure—nonprofit, religious organisation, private retreat?"

Paula's smile thinned. "We are a community built on—"

"I didn't ask for philosophy." Julia stepped closer. The circle contracted around the confrontation. "I asked for facts. Registration documents. Tax records. Founding charter."

"One does not reduce healing work to bureaucracy."

"One absolutely does when people are being manipulated."

Gasps rippled through the circle. Mia's hands clenched. Bobi took a half-step backward.

Julia turned, addressing the entire circle. "Has anyone here verified anything about this place? Have you seen accreditation? Licenses for therapeutic practice? Background checks on facilitators?"

"Julia." Klaudia's voice held warning, but Julia ignored it.

She swung back to Paula. "And where's Aya right now?"

Paula blinked. "I beg your pardon?"

"Aya. The woman whose trauma story Mia performed last night." Julia scanned the circle. "She's not here. She's never here in the mornings, is she? I've watched for four days. Paula dominates six to ten AM. Aya appears at lunch, stays through dinner, retires early claiming exhaustion. Every single day. Same pattern."

The circle shifted again. Heads turning, searching. Aya's absence suddenly conspicuous.

Paula's theatrical warmth evaporated. "Aya struggles with morning energy. We accommodate individual needs here."

"Right. Individual needs. Like the need to never be in the same space as Paula at the same time."

Kyle's hand went still in his pocket. Across the circle, Klaudia's eyes locked on Julia's back. Mia's flush deepened, spreading to her neck.

"This is precisely the kind of paranoid thinking that prevents—" Paula began.

"It's not paranoia." Julia's voice dropped, became surgical. "It's pattern recognition. And the pattern says you're running scripted performances on a schedule that ensures certain people never overlap. So I'll ask again: where is Aya right now? And why is she never here when you are?"

The Midnight Sun pressed down. The birdsong looped. Paula stood frozen, maternal mask cracking at the edges.

* * *

Paula's hands folded together, fingers lacing with practiced grace. The crack in her facade smoothed over like water closing around a stone.

"You are afraid," Paula said, her voice dropping to therapeutic softness. "This is understandable. Vulnerability feels threatening when you have spent so long protecting yourself."

Julia's jaw tightened. "That's not—"

"You demand documents, structures, proof." Paula turned to the circle, including them in her diagnosis. "These are walls Julia has built to keep intimacy at a distance. She cannot trust, so she must control. She cannot feel, so she must interrogate."

Murmurs rippled through the group. Heads nodded. The same heads that had nodded when Mia condemned Kyle.

"I'm asking for basic transparency," Julia said, voice steady but the fork-setting stare losing its edge against Paula's maternal gravity.

"You are asking for permission to dismiss." Paula stepped closer. "If I provide documents, you will question their authenticity. If I explain Aya's schedule, you will invent new suspicions. This is the nature of resistance—it moves the goalpost endlessly to avoid confronting the real fear."

Kyle observed Julia's shoulders pull back, defensive architecture activating. Beside him, Eline's fingers had stopped tapping. Klaudia watched the circle, cataloguing which faces showed doubt and which showed certainty.

"What are you afraid of, Julia?" Paula's tone remained gentle, dissecting. "What truth about yourself becomes visible when you stop policing others?"

Bobi shifted his weight. His carved figure disappeared into his pocket.

Mia spoke, voice raw. "Paula's right. You've been watching everyone since we arrived. Taking notes with your eyes. You're doing exactly what Kyle does—treating people like suspects."

"That's not the same thing," Julia said, but her voice had lost its surgical precision.

"Isn't it?" Mia's flush crawled higher. "You corner people. You test them with fake questions. You act like you're better than this place, but you're here, same as us."

Several guests nodded. The circle's energy shifted, coalescing around Julia as the new target. Paula stepped back, allowing the group to complete her work.

Kyle touched the moissanite stones. Noted the technique. The deflection, the reframe, the weaponised collective. Paula hadn't answered a single question.

She'd simply made asking them a symptom of disease.

* * *

#### Chapter 6: The Script is Read (Day 4 at Hårga) - Scene 9

Klaudia watched Julia's surgical questioning blunt itself against Paula's therapeutic armour. The circle turned predator, their collective gaze fixing on Julia with the same righteous certainty that had condemned Kyle twelve hours earlier.

This wasn't working.

Logic didn't penetrate here. Facts dissolved in the golden light like salt in water. Julia could demand documents until her voice gave out, and Paula would simply reframe each question as evidence of pathology. The group would nod, validate, consume the performance like gospel.

Klaudia's fingers tightened around her spiral notebook, pressing into the cardboard backing. Inside: surveillance grids, cottage positions, the damning registry evidence from Day 3. Three cottages. One booking. One credit card. Aya's arrival two months before Kyle finalized their trip.

None of it mattered to people who'd stopped caring about timestamps and paper trails.

Her gaze drifted past the circle, past the Maypole's shadow stretching across trampled wildflowers, towards the cluster of administrative buildings at the property's edge. The Staff Cottage sat forty metres from the Longhouse, its windows reflecting the relentless sun. Small. Practical. Where Saga kept the guest registry, the printer logs, the communication equipment.

Where Klaudia had already violated privacy protocols once.

Paula's voice carried across the meadow. "We hold space for Julia's resistance. We trust she will find her way to openness when she is ready."

Translation: the interrogation was over. Julia had been diagnosed, dismissed, and framed as someone requiring patient tolerance rather than engagement.

Klaudia closed her notebook. Stored Julia's failure in the same mental file as Kyle's Grey Rock composure—strategies that worked in rational environments, useless in ecosystems designed to pathologise self-defence.

She needed different tactics.

Paula gestured for the circle to rise. Bodies unfolded in the grass, white linen shifting like wheat in wind. Mia moved towards her, protective.

Klaudia stood, modified linen settling around her functional boots. She scanned the property with the same methodical attention she'd used to map emergency exits on arrival. The Workshop Barn stood to the west. The Longhouse dominated the meadow's northern edge. The three western cottages—where Aya, Paula, and Dawid supposedly slept—formed a triangle near the tree line.

And the Staff Cottage sat isolated, accessible, probably empty during morning sessions when Saga facilitated elsewhere.

Julia passed Klaudia, jaw set, eyes forward. Their fingers brushed. Klaudia tapped once against Julia's wrist—message received, fall back, regroup.

"Klaudia." Saga's voice, warm and administrative, materialized at her shoulder. "You look troubled."

Klaudia turned, arranging her features into neutral concern. "Just processing Julia's… struggle."

Saga smiled with practiced sympathy. "Transparency can feel threatening to those who've relied on control. She'll find her way."

"I hope so." Klaudia glanced towards the Staff Cottage, deliberate casualness. "Is the device lockbox accessible today? I promised my sister I'd check in."

"Of course." Saga's expression remained open, helpful. "I'll be facilitating the afternoon craft session, but the cottage is always unlocked during daytime hours. Your phone is in the wooden box on the second shelf."

Perfect.

"Thank you." Klaudia tucked her notebook under her arm, already calculating. Afternoon craft session meant two hours minimum. Saga anchored in the Workshop Barn, performing maternal presence whilst participants wove or carved or surrendered their defences through manual labour.

Two hours to access the printer logs. To photograph whatever documentation existed beyond the registry. To find proof that couldn't be reframed as psychological resistance.

Because if confrontation failed, documentation remained.

And Klaudia had always trusted paper more than people.

### Chapter 7: The Unsettling Mimicry (Day 5 at Hårga)

The Maypole Meadow stretched under a sky that pressed down like heated glass. No shadows pooled at the edges. The golden light flattened everything into a single plane of exposure, wildflowers bleaching to pale smears against the grass. The group formed a ragged circle around the pole, white linen clinging damp from the morning's dew. Birds looped their endless call overhead, a thin wire of sound slicing the air. Kyle sat at the periphery, knees drawn up, moissanite stones cool in his pocket. Eline balanced her notepad on one thigh. Julia crossed her arms, eyes narrowed against the glare. Bobi fidgeted, then stilled. Klaudia scanned the tree line. Mia held the center, her flower crown listing to one side.

But Aya spoke first. She rose from her spot near the pole, dark hair loose, linen swallowing her frame. Her voice cracked the circle's hush, carrying Mia's ragged edge but delayed, each word landing a half-beat behind the rhythm.

"We gather here for emotional resonance."

Resonance. She let the word hang, then repeated it. "Resonance requires a vessel. Without the vessel, no true connection flows."

Bobi leaned forward, cross-legged, his carved wooden figure forgotten in the grass. His eyes locked on Aya, wide and unblinking. He nodded once, sharp, then again in time with her cadence—manic pulses that matched the birdsong's loop.

Aya paced the circle's edge, bare feet silent on trampled blooms. "Resonance demands we empty ourselves. Become the vessel for what others carry. Mia showed us this yesterday. Her words broke open the air. Now, we carry that resonance forward."

Julia shifted on the grass, skin crawling under the flat light. Aya turned, locking eyes with the empty space where Mia sat. Her gaze mimicked Mia's—the flushed challenge, the jaw set forward—but her pupils stayed fixed pinpoints. No dilation against the glare. No flicker. Julia's breath caught. The meadow blurred at the corners, edges glitching like a render stuttering under load. Aya's face hovered there, too still, too precise. Julia pressed her palms into the earth, grounding the vertigo.

"Resonance is not noise," Aya continued, voice lagging again, mechanical in its push. "It is the vessel receiving what must be released. Vessel. Resonance. We repeat until the words strip bare."

Bobi nodded harder, his head bobbing like a metronome. "Yeah. Vessel. That's it." His fingers twitched toward his pocket, empty without cards. He stared at Aya as if she channeled something vital, a bleached echo of Mia's fire. Comfort settled in his posture, strange and absolute. The group murmured agreement, voices blending with the river's distant rush.

Kyle cataloged the shift. The circle's language twisted overnight. Ascension crept in—whispers of Mia's "ascension" through her outburst, now elevated to ritual. Words infected the air like a virus, rewriting intent. His mind snagged on the pattern: resonance, vessel, ascension. He reached for his journal, pen scratching a note. But the entry blurred in his thoughts—a space before the comma, unbidden. The group's data points corrupted. The sun pinned him, unblinking eye curating every observation. His logic frayed at the edges.

The circle broke for midday, bodies dispersing toward the Longhouse. Heat thickened by noon, the light turning viscous. Eline lingered, notepad in hand, as Paula gathered a smaller cluster near the pole. Paula adjusted her shawl, blonde bun tight, glasses catching the glare.

"You must reflect on what the resonance stirs," Paula said, voice maternal, imperative. She extended her left hand, gesturing to the meadow. "One does not resist the vessel's call."

Eline nodded, clinical distance holding. But her gaze dropped to Paula's index finger. A scar there—jagged, pale, curving like a crescent moon. The 2:00 PM light hit it square, making the skin vibrate. Edges bled white, pulsing against the bone. Eline's stomach lurched. Visual vertigo gripped her—the meadow tilted, wildflowers smearing into streaks. That scar. Identical to Aya's, glimpsed yesterday during the crown-weaving when Aya fumbled a stem. Same position. Same faint ridge.

Her pen moved before thought formed. Noted: scar match, left index, Paula/Aya. Vibration under glare. Possible shared injury? Or— The scratch of graphite on paper echoed too loud in the hush, birdsong cutting out for a breath. Paula turned, eyes narrowing behind lenses.

"Is something troubling you, Eline?"

Eline closed the pad. "Just documenting the session."

Paula's smile warmed, but her finger tapped the scar once. "One must trust the process over the notes. Reflection serves the resonance."

The group filtered back, plates from the Longhouse in hand—pale bread, watery stew. Aya reemerged at the circle's edge, timing precise, claiming a spot beside Bobi. She picked up the thread without pause.

"Resonance builds on what came before," she said, voice lagging into Mia's texture again. "Vessel receives. Vessel echoes."

Bobi leaned closer, eyes still wide. "Echoes Mia. She ascended in that moment, right? Broke it all open."

Aya nodded, slow. "Exactly. Her vessel passed the resonance to us."

Julia watched from her perch on a low rise, the uncanny pull tightening her chest. Aya's pupils held steady as she scanned the circle, mimicking that forward stare. The light rendered her skin waxy, irises flat black voids. Julia's vision stuttered—the pole's maypole garland flickered, petals detaching in slow motion. Digital fault line. She glanced at Klaudia, who met her eyes across the grass. Silent signal: watch the mimic.

Kyle's pen hovered over his journal. The group's rhetoric looped now, ascension virus spreading. Bobi's nod. Eline's scratch. Julia's glance. He wrote: Patterns indicate curated narrative , space slipping in uninvited. His own thoughts glitched. The sun's weight pressed harder, data points refracting through its lens. Objective observation? No. Curated. He snapped the journal shut, moissanite digging into his palm.

Mia pushed into the circle late, crown askew, stew bowl steaming. She dropped beside Aya, voice raw. "What'd I miss? More vessel talk?"

Aya turned, cadence syncing closer. "Your resonance, Mia. We carry it."

Bobi grinned, manic edge softening. "It's like you're here in her. Comforting, yeah?"

Mia barked a laugh, but her eyes searched Aya's face. The lag hit then—Aya's echo off by fractions, intensity dialed mechanical. Mia frowned, spoon pausing mid-air.

Paula circled back, shawl fluttering. "One does not question the vessel's form. Resonance flows regardless."

Eline reopened her notepad, scar image burning. Vibration lingered in her periphery, light bleeding the edges. She scribbled: Correlation demands verification. Shared trauma? Or fabrication. The pen's scratch pulled stares. Bobi tilted his head.

"Sounds intense. Like data crunching souls."

Kyle's grip tightened. Data. His word, corrupted. The meadow's overexposure flattened the circle into one plane—resonance, vessel, ascension blurring into code. The sun watched, unyielding. He stood, linen stark against the grass.

"Session's dragging," he said, voice low, resonant. "Break it."

But Aya's voice cut through, lag pulling taut. "Resonance doesn't break. It echoes."

Bobi nodded, eyes fixed. Julia's skin prickled deeper, pupils unchanging in the glare. Eline's vertigo spun the scar white. Kyle felt the virus in his veins, comma slipping: the light curates all.

The circle held, light weighting every breath.

* * *

The circle dissolved under the relentless gold. Feet shuffled through trampled grass. Wildflowers crushed beneath soles, releasing sharp, green bursts that clawed the air. Aya led the way toward the river, her linen tunic clinging damp to her back. She paused at the meadow's edge, hand shading eyes despite the glare. "The water calls now. Resonance needs flow."

Bobi trailed her, wooden figure clutched tight. His knuckles blanched around the carving. "Flow. Yeah. Like yesterday, but bigger."

Klaudia hung back, spiral notebook wedged under her arm. Boots crunched gravel louder than the birdsong loop. Julia matched her stride, linen knotted at the waist like a scarf. No words passed. Their eyes met once—quick flick, shared weight. Mia pushed ahead, crown lopsided, petals shedding with each step. Eline followed, notepad open, pen scratching amid the vibration. Kyle brought up the rear, journal pocketed, moissanite stones heavy against thigh.

The path sloped down. Limestone outcrops gleamed bone-white, heat radiating up in waves. River roar built gradual. Low thunder at first, then a wall of sound crashing against eardrums. The air thickened, wet and mineral, carrying foam's bitter tang. Trees thinned. The bank emerged—a strip of eroded soil, slick with recent rain.

The river surged. No longer dark ribbon slicing forest. Churning beast now, opaque white veined with silt. Rain from nights past had swollen it triple-wide, current frothing violent. Sun struck the surface. Blinding sheet exploded back, pure glare erasing depth. Waves crested foam-lipped, collapsing into spray that stung exposed skin. Kyle blinked hard. Spots bloomed in vision, afterimages of liquid fire.

Saga stood at the bank, clipboard loose in one hand. Ingrid flanked her, arms crossed, face serene as carved wood. Other facilitators dotted the line—five in total, linens pristine, wildflower crowns untouched by wind. They formed a human barrier, gazes fixed on the torrent. No movement. Beatific masks held, lips curved faint.

"The bridge," Saga said, voice slicing the roar soft. She gestured upstream. "Nature's gift. Isolation sharpens us."

The structure loomed partial ruin. Wooden planks warped, half-submerged. Posts jutted skeletal from foam, railings splintered where current clawed. Water surged around the base, erasing lower spans in a boil of white. No path across. Just froth swallowing timber, sun reflecting off it in fractured mirrors. One plank tilted loose, rocking with each swell.

Ingrid nodded toward the chaos. "See how it purifies. No distractions beyond. Focus turns inward. Resonance blooms here."

Her words floated light, almost lost in the river's bellow. But they landed heavy. Linguistic cage snapped shut. Kyle felt it click—facilitators' calm reframing the trap as therapy. Paradise's bars, gilded. The group clustered behind them. Bobi edged forward, carving forgotten in his fist.

"Purifies," he echoed, voice pitching high over the din. "Like the ritual. Washes out the noise."

Aya stepped beside Saga, gaze on the foam. "Exactly. Vessel empties. Fills clean."

Mia planted feet wide, spray misting her calves. "Clean. Right. No escaping this mess now."

Julia's jaw tightened. She scanned the bank upstream, then down. No alternate crossing. Forest choked both sides, undergrowth impenetrable. The roar pulsed. Interrupted thought. River. Foam. Glare. She gripped Klaudia's sleeve brief. Fabric bunched under fingers.

Klaudia pulled away gentle. Advanced to the bridge's mouth. One boot probed the first plank—rotten wood groaned under weight. Vibration shot up her leg. Current's fury thrummed through sole, calf, knee. Bone-deep rattle. She froze. Water lapped inches below, froth bubbling greedy. Plank shifted half-inch, threatening tilt.

"Slippery," Klaudia called back, voice flat. "Holds, but barely."

Julia met her eyes across the gap. Grim. Silent. No need for more. The glance sealed it—stranded. Outside world severed clean. No quick dash to town. No signal boost beyond the bridge. Their pincer on Aya? Stalled. River's white wall mocked the plan.

Eline scribbled fast. Notepad trembled in grip. "Current velocity increased post-rain. Bridge integrity compromised." Ink smeared where spray hit page. She glanced at Aya, then Saga. "How long until it recedes?"

Saga's smile deepened. "Time enough for work. Isolation gifts clarity. Why rush outward when resonance waits within?"

The words wrapped tight. Soothe on surface. Cage beneath. Bobi nodded, transfixed by the foam. "Clarity. Yeah. No more distractions."

Kyle positioned at the torrent's edge. Gravel bit heels. He stared into the churn—opaque mass devouring light, spitting it back fractured. No bottom visible. Just endless white boil. Spray flecked his face, cold pinpricks against sun-baked skin. The roar filled skull. Drowned birdsong. Drowned breath.

He lifted gaze. Midnight Sun hung high, unyielding. No dip toward horizon. Perpetual blaze, gold turning sterile. Shadows? Absent. Every leaf edge sharp, every face outlined merciless. The sky watched. Unblinking eye, vast. No nightfall veil. No cover in black. Escape plotted under this? Every step tracked. Every whisper amplified.

"Sterile cage," Kyle murmured, voice lost to water. Moissanite warmed in pocket, prisms firing faint against thigh. He catalogued it—bridge flooded Day 5, post-rain. Isolation enforced. Facilitators' frame: therapeutic. Reality: lockdown. Journal itch burned, but hands stayed pocketed. Too exposed here. River interrupted. Glare. Foam. Watchers on bank.

Aya turned to him, pupils flat in the reflection. "The water mirrors us, Kyle. What do you see?"

He met her stare. Lag in her cadence echoed Mia's still, but question hung loaded. "Obstruction."

Ingrid laughed soft, almost melody. "Or opportunity. Resonance thrives in constraint."

Bobi shifted closer to Aya, carving tapping his leg nervous. "Constraint. Builds strength, right? Like the ritual."

Mia snorted, but spray cut it short. "Strength. Or drowns you."

Julia pulled Klaudia back from the plank. Their shoulders brushed. Silent signal again—reassess. Notebook emerged in Klaudia's hand. She sketched quick: bridge span, current arrow thick. Julia nodded once. Eyes on Saga now, who watched the group with that clipboard tilt.

Eline's pen raced. Vibration from Klaudia's test lingered in her own stance—earth humming underfoot. "Perceived isolation heightens paranoia. Classic dynamic." She snapped the pad shut. Glare off river hit her face, forcing squint. Spots danced. Vertigo tugged. Limestone bank blurred white. River white. Sun white. One plane.

The facilitators held position. Unmoving statues. Saga raised clipboard, sun glinting off metal clip. "Let's sit. Share what the water stirs."

Group lowered to damp grass. Circle reformed, backs to the roar. Aya sat cross-legged, hands on knees. "My vessel feels it. Purge."

Bobi mirrored her. "Purge. Clean start."

Kyle sat last, edge of the bank. Water's breath chilled calves. Sun bored down. No escape in dusk. No reprieve. The cage gleamed.

Klaudia whispered to Julia, river masking it partial. "Printer logs tomorrow. Before it worsens."

Julia's nod was steel. "If we can cross at all."

The roar swelled. Foam crested higher, swallowing another plank's tip. Spray arced, drenching linen hems. Saga's voice rose serene. "Embrace the gift. Speak your resonance."

Aya leaned forward. "The water takes what blocks us."

Mia gripped grass blades, roots tearing free. "Takes. Yeah."

Eline's vertigo spun the circle. Faces waxy. Light bled edges. Bobi's carving dropped into mud—sank slow. He didn't notice.

Kyle's fingers closed on moissanite. Prisms fired, but dimmed against the white-out. The sun watched. River purified. Group echoed. Cage locked.

Ingrid's eyes swept them. "Isolation heals. Trust the flow."

Flow. Roar. Glare. Kyle's thoughts fragmented. Bridge gone. Path fragile. Gaze eternal.

The circle tightened. Words tumbled soft against the wall of water. Resonance. Vessel. Purge. The sun refused to blink.

### Chapter 8: The Petition (Day 5 at Hårga)

The bell tore through dawn like a shard.

Not metal. Not wind. Hand-carved oak, struck with a mallet. A single, high-frequency pulse that vibrated the jawbone. It came from the Glass Pavilion.

Inside the glass, the light had already begun—flat, total. No gradient. No shadow pools in the corners. Just white, pressing in from all sides. The air hummed. Heat shivered off the glass, carrying ozone and something else: cloying, overripe florals. Funeral lilies drowned in perfume.

Paula stood at the center.

Blonde bun tight as surgical wrap. Knitted shawl draped with geometric precision. Glasses up, lenses catching the sun full. Her eyes—gone. Only glare, sharp as scalpels, sent back at the group as they filed in.

One after another. Linen uniform. No variations. No folds. Worn now, yes—Bobi’s grass-stained at the hem, Mia’s bunched at the waist, Kyle’s still pristine. But white. All white. Even Eline, her slate-grey scarf abandoned in the sleeping cottage, sleeves pulled tight over her wrists like armor against exposure.

They sat on low wooden stools. Arranged in an open semicircle. No sound but the low thrum of the structure, sun hitting glass, skin, bone.

Paula inhaled. The scent rolled with her breath.

“One must begin,” she said, voice high, even, maternal—like a doctor explaining a necessary cut. “With the understanding that we are being watched. Not by me. Not by the facilitators. But by the light.”

Her head tilted up. The overhead sun struck her lenses. A flare, blinding.

“The Midnight Sun sees all. And it reflects only truth. So we must allow ourselves to be seen.”

She raised a stack of papers.

“Private thoughts are the seeds of rot. They grow in silence. They feed on secrets. And when nourished, they spread—like a tumor—to the collective vessel.”

Mia’s knuckles whitened on her knees. Julia kept her face neutral, eyes forward. Klaudia’s boots had been swapped for slippers. Still, she sat with spine rigid.

Paula stepped forward, handed a sheet to each.

The paper was not the commune’s recycled cream.

Bright white. Industrial. Bleached. Kyle took his. Felt the grain. Not hand-pressed. Office stock. He looked down.

**Reflection Prompt: Radical Disclosure — Day 5**

*In the light, all shadows are dissolved. What have you withheld? What private judgment, unspoken resentment, or hidden agenda have you carried into this sanctuary? One does not speak of such things lightly. One must let them breathe. One must watch them wilt in the sun.*

Kyle’s eyes snagged on the third sentence.

*One does not speak of such things lightly .*

There it was.

Space before the comma.

His pulse clicked—once. Hard against the ribs.

He glanced at Eline. She was reading, fingers at the corner of the page. He didn’t speak. Couldn’t. But his thumb brushed the paper—once down, twice. A tap only she would know. *Anomaly.*

Eline exhaled. Subtle. She’d seen it.

Paula continued, pacing the edge of the glass circle.

“It is not cruelty to expose. It is kindness. The scalpel removes the cancer. And we are all surgeons here.”

Her voice didn’t rise. Never raised. But it grew heavier. Each word dropped like a stone into still water.

“And so we see,” she said, “when one body fails to synchronize… when one mind refuses resonance… it creates friction. Dissonance.”

Her pause was long. Measured.

Then: “One cannot claim transparency while hoarding data in a house of light.”

All faces turned. Not all. Most.

Bobi stared. Julia studied the floor. Klaudia’s notebook was strapped to her thigh now, under the linen. Not in hand. Not yet.

Kyle sat still. Jaw set. Moissanite in pocket—tight. Warm.

Paula looked at him. Or seemed to. The reflecting lenses gave nothing.

“Silence,” she said, “is not neutrality. Silence is a signal. Loud, constant, dripping with resistance. One must not hide behind numbers here. That is not clarity. That is hiding.”

*The Gray Rock held.*

He didn’t blink. Didn’t shift.

“You are being loud with your silence, Kyle,” she said. “One does not get to observe without consequence.”

The phrase landed.

Julia’s head lifted. That wasn’t communal jargon. “One…” That was Paula’s signature. Imperial Imperative. Not Aya’s therapy-speak. Not Dawid’s aggression. This was hierarchy. Command.

Paula stepped back.

“Now,” she said, “we begin the circle. Radical Disclosure. One true thing you have not spoken.”

She nodded to Bobi.

Bobi stood. Nodded fast. Hands fluttering, then stilling on his lap.

“I… I doubted whether I belonged. At the start. That I was only here because Kyle let me come. That you all… tolerated me.”

He looked at Kyle now. No malice. But no warmth.

“I thought I was a charity case.”

Paula placed a hand on his shoulder. Brief. Paternal.

“Truth is a gift,” she said. “We receive it.”

Bobi sat.

Mia rose.

“I doubted whether feeling deeply was weakness,” she said. Voice raw. “I thought my strength was too much. That people feared it. That Kyle feared it. That he used logic to shame it.”

Her gaze found Kyle.

“But now I see. He doesn’t fear it. He uses it. To justify his detachment.”

Paula nodded. Slow. Approving.

Julia stood. Minimal movement.

“I doubted this place was real,” she said. “That what we’re doing matters. That Paula speaks from knowledge, not performance.”

A beat. Long. The pavilion held its breath.

Paula didn’t flinch. Just smiled. “One resists when one is close to breakthrough.”

Julia sat. Said nothing more.

Klaudia stood.

“I doubted my ability to stay awake another night without sleep,” she said. Voice flat. Truth, yes. But armor.

Paula accepted it.

Eline stood last before Kyle. She looked down at her sheet. The glitch sat there like a virus in the text.

“I doubted,” she said, slow, “whether I could remain objective. That I could separate clinical observation from personal investment.”

Paula stepped toward her. “One always risks contamination when healing,” she said. “But to admit it—this is progress.”

Eline sat.

Now only Kyle remained.

Paula turned to him. “You understand the ritual.”

He stood.

“I observe behavior patterns,” he said. “Not to hoard data. To understand group dynamics. To detect manipulation.”

Silence.

Paula tilted her head. “And yet, Kyle, you do not disclose. You only deflect.”

He looked across the glass. The meadow. The western cottages. Distance distorted in the glare.

“I did not come here to accuse,” he said. “But to correct dysfunction.”

Paula took a breath.

Then: “**One does not hide behind numbers here. You are being loud with your silence.**”

Her voice was calm. Unhurried.

But the entire circle shifted.

Bobi stood first. Hands shaking no longer. He turned his stool. Swiveled. Back now to Kyle. Full.

Then Mia.

Then Klaudia. Hesitated. One glance at Kyle. Then turned.

Eline. Jaw clenched. She turned.

Julia. Last. She looked at the reflection sheet. At the space before the comma.

Then she turned her back.

The White Void.

Kyle stood in the center of a circle of backs. Six identical white linen forms. Not hostile. Not angry. Just… gone. Emptied.

The heat pressed down. Ozone sharp in the nose. Floral scent thick enough to choke.

Outside, the Midday Sun blazed.

Inside, Kyle remained standing.

Not broken.

Not shouting.

But unmade.

One does not speak of such things.

One only disappears—together.

* * *

The limestone path burned white. Kyle walked it anyway.

His boots made no sound on the baked stone. No crunch of gravel, no whisper of dust. Just the endless loop of birdsong—same three notes, repeating. The sun hung directly overhead, a bleach lamp with no switch. He squinted against the glare, but his pupils couldn’t contract enough. The cottages ahead pulsed. Not swayed. Pulsed. White on white on white, the edges vibrating like a misaligned projector.

*Ten metres to Paula’s door.*

He counted steps. One. Two. The numbers helped. Three. Four. The path didn’t slope, but his stomach lurched like he was tilting. Five. Six. His moissanite stones dug into his palm. Seven. Eight. The stones were the only fixed point—cold, geometric, *real*. Nine. Ten.

Paula’s cottage stood apart from the others. Not by distance. By precision. The flower boxes were symmetrical. The door hinges oiled. The windowsill scrubbed to a sterile shine. No pollen dusted the ledge. No insects dared the threshold.

Kyle stopped three metres out.

The towel was the first anomaly.

Draped over the porch chair, half-folded, half-abandoned. White linen, identical to the retreat’s uniforms. But wrong. The fold was too sharp. Hospital corners. Military precision. Not the loose drape of someone who’d just bathed. Not the careless toss of someone at ease.

He stepped closer.

The hair was the second.

One strand. Black. Long. Caught in the weave of the towel’s border. It coiled like a question mark against the bleached fabric, defiant in its darkness. Kyle’s fingers hovered. Didn’t touch. *Document first.*

He pulled his journal from his back pocket. The leather was warm from his body heat. He flipped to a fresh page, but the glare off the paper made the lines swim. He shielded it with his body, casting the only shadow in Hårga—a sliver of gray, just enough to see.

*10:17 AM. Western Cottage #2 (Paula’s assigned residence).*

*Visual: Discarded towel, white linen, 60x90cm, folded with 90-degree precision.*

*Anomaly: Single black hair, \~15cm, caught in weave at 3rd warp thread from SE corner.*

*Context: Paula’s documented hair color = blonde (observed: bun, no roots, no regrowth).*

*Hypothesis: Contamination. Or performance.*

He sketched the towel’s position relative to the door. The hair’s location. The angle of the fold.

The scent hit him as he capped his pen.

Not flowers. Not the wild meadow sweetness that clung to the Longhouse. This was thicker. Heavier. A funeral spray—lilies and something chemical underneath, like formaldehyde trying to mask decay. It coated his throat. Made his sinuses burn. He swallowed and tasted it on his tongue.

*Clinical cover-up.*

The thought arrived fully formed. Not panic. Not yet. Just data.

He stepped back.

The cottage door was ajar.

Not by much. Two centimetres. Enough to see the darkness inside—a slash of void in the whiteout. Enough to hear the sound.

*Click-hiss.*

Mechanical. Rhythmic. Like a dial-up modem handshaking. Then a voice, distorted, testing scales:

*—one two three*

*—one two three test*

*—listen—*

The voice modulator.

Kyle’s pulse spiked. His vision tunneled. The edges of the cottage blurred, the limestone path tilting like a ship’s deck. The birdsong looped, the same three notes, but now it wasn’t birds—it was a alarm. A warning. A countdown.

*Stage 2: Sensory Overload.*

He knew the symptoms. Had read the GlowGlitch beta-test reports. Users described it as "reality lag"—the brain’s attempt to process too much input with too little contrast. The Midnight Sun erased shadows. The white linen erased individuality. The constant exposure erased privacy. Now the evidence was erasing logic.

*Click-hiss.*

*—one two three—*

His hand went to his pocket. The moissanite stones were there. Solid. *Real.* He gripped one between his thumb and forefinger, pressed the facets into his skin. Pain was an anchor.

*Breathe. Document. Retreat.*

He forced his journal open again. The pen trembled in his grip.

*10:21 AM. Auditory anomaly:*

*—Voice modulator active inside Cottage #2 (confirmed by "click-hiss" signature, identical to Dawid’s vocal distortion).*

*—Test phrase repeated: "one two three" (3x) + "listen" (1x, aggressive inflection).*

*—No visual on speaker. Door ajar 2cm, interior dark (contrasts with 100% light saturation outside = deliberate obscuration).*

*—Hypothesis: Transition protocol. Paula → ?*

He didn’t write the next thought.

*Aya.*

The name burned in his skull. But the pen wouldn’t form it. Not yet. Not without more.

The modulator hissed again.

*—listen—*

Closer now. Like the speaker had moved toward the door.

Kyle stepped back. Then again. The limestone path was a runway. No cover. No shadows. Just the relentless light and the scent of lilies and the sound of his own breath, too loud, too fast.

*Retreat.*

He turned.

The meadow stretched behind him, golden and endless. The Longhouse was a white smudge in the distance. The Maypole stood sentinel, its ribbons limp in the still air. No one was outside. No one ever was, not at this hour. The retreat ran on a schedule. 10:00–12:00 was the Bleach Gap—the time when Paula vanished and Aya had yet to emerge.

*Two more hours until the transition completes.*

He forced his legs to move. One step. Then another. The path didn’t steady. The birdsong didn’t stop. The scent clung to his clothes, his hair, his skin.

At the tree line, he paused. Looked back.

Paula’s cottage was just another white box now. Indistinguishable. The towel still draped over the chair. The black hair still coiled in the weave.

Waiting.

### Chapter 9: Root Cellar Reflections (Day 6 at Hårga)

---

**Scene 9.1: The Olfactory Anchor**

---

**08:00 – The Communal Kitchen**

The lye burned first.

Eline stepped into the kitchen, and the scent hit her like a chemical slap. The floor had been scrubbed with something caustic—industrial, not organic. The kind of clean that didn’t just remove dirt but dissolved it. She exhaled through her mouth, tasting the sharpness at the back of her throat.

Paula stood at the counter, her back to the door. She wore a shawl despite the heat, the knit draped over her shoulders like a second skin. Her hands moved with deliberate precision, crushing something in a mortar. The sound was wet. Organic. Not the dry rustle of herbs, but something pulpy. Berries, maybe. Or petals.

“You’re early,” Paula said. Not an accusation. A statement. Her voice carried the same uncanny cadence it always did—the **Imperial Imperative**, the tone that made requests sound like commands.

Eline didn’t apologize. She never did. Instead, she reached for the kettle, her fingers brushing the cool metal. “I couldn’t sleep.”

Paula didn’t turn. “The light does that. It exposes what we try to hide.”

The mortar’s rhythm didn’t falter. *Crush. Grind. Crush.*

Eline filled the kettle, the water rushing in too loud. She set it on the stove, the flame clicking to life with a blue snap. The kitchen was all white wood and harsh angles, the counters scrubbed to a sterile sheen. No crumbs. No stains. No evidence of human error.

Only the scent.

It coiled around Eline’s ribs, thick and sweet and wrong. Lilies. High-note, aggressive. Not the wild jasmine that clung to the meadow or the damp earth smell of the riverbank. This was **sanitary**. A funeral parlor trying to mask the rot beneath the flowers.

Paula finally turned. Her shawl shifted, revealing the crescent scar on her left index finger—the one Eline had noticed yesterday. Today, it looked fresher. Angrier. The skin around it was raised, the edges too precise, like it had been re-opened.

“You’re trembling,” Paula observed.

Eline wasn’t. But her pulse was a drumbeat in her wrists. She reached for her notepad—habit, anchor—but her pocket was empty. She’d left it in the dormitory. A mistake.

Paula’s eyes flicked to Eline’s hands. “You don’t need to document this.”

“Document what?”

“The way your body reacts to the truth.” Paula slid the mortar toward her. Inside, the crushed petals were a violent pink, the juice dark as arterial blood. “Smell.”

Eline didn’t want to. But her fingers moved anyway, obeying the command before her mind could protest. She leaned in.

The scent was worse up close. Not just lilies—something underneath. Chemical. Astringent. Like formaldehyde trying to disguise itself as perfume.

Her stomach lurched.

Paula’s lips curved. Not a smile. A confirmation. “The body knows before the mind does.”

Eline straightened. The kettle whistled, a sharp scream in the silence. She poured the water into two mugs, the steam rising between them. Paula didn’t touch hers.

“What is this for?” Eline asked, nodding at the mortar.

“Morning tonic. For the circle.” Paula’s fingers hovered over the petals, then stilled. “You should drink it. It helps with the… *adjustment*.”

Eline didn’t ask what needed adjusting. She already knew.

---

**11:45 – The Bleach Gap**

Kyle stood twenty metres from the Western Cottage, motionless.

The meadow was empty. The group had migrated to the Workshop Barn for the midday craft session—weaving, or crown-making, or whatever performative vulnerability Paula had scheduled. The Longhouse was silent. The bridge was still flooded, the river a churning brown monster beneath the rotting planks.

And the cottage door was closed.

He’d been watching since 10:30. Since Paula had exited, her shawl draped just so, her steps unhurried as she crossed the meadow toward the Glass Pavilion. Since the door had clicked shut behind her.

Since the silence had begun.

No movement. No sound. Just the birdsong looping, the same three notes, the same endless sun.

He touched the moissanite in his pocket. The stone was warm from his body heat, the facets sharp against his fingertips. He didn’t take it out. Not yet. The light would refract, and the light was already too much.

*11:47 AM. Western Cottage #2. Observation log:*

*—Paula exit: 10:28 AM (confirmed by Glass Pavilion arrival, 10:31 AM).*

*—No subsequent movement. No shadow under door. No auditory signals.*

*—Hypothesis: Transition protocol active. 2-hour window (10:30 AM–12:30 PM = "Bleach Gap").*

*—Anomaly: No Dawid sighting post-10:00 AM. Possible schedule deviation?*

He didn’t write the rest.

*Aya should emerge at 12:00 PM. But the cottage is too still.*

The air smelled wrong. Not the lilies—something else. Something metallic, like ozone before a storm. He breathed through his mouth, but it coated his tongue anyway.

A sound.

Not from the cottage. From the tree line.

He turned.

Eline stood ten metres away, her slate-grey dress a dark smear against the white linen of the meadow. She wasn’t looking at him. She was looking at the cottage, her fingers flexing like she’d lost something.

“You saw it too,” she said.

Not a question.

He didn’t answer. Didn’t need to.

She stepped closer. The distance between them was deliberate. Not too near. Not too far. A forensic buffer.

“Paula’s scent,” she said. “It’s on *her* too.”

No name. No accusation. Just data.

Kyle’s throat was dry. “Aya.”

Eline’s jaw tightened. “Same chemical signature. Same *weight*. Like it’s not perfume. Like it’s…” She trailed off, her eyes flicking to the cottage. “Like it’s a mask.”

The door creaked.

Both of them froze.

The handle turned. Slow. Deliberate.

The door opened.

Aya stood in the threshold, blinking against the light. Her hair was loose, dark strands clinging to her neck. She wore the same white linen as everyone else, but hers was wrinkled, the hem uneven, like she’d dressed in a hurry.

Like she’d *changed* in a hurry.

She took a breath. Held it.

Then she stepped forward, and the scent hit them both—a wave of lilies, so thick it was almost *visible*, shimmering in the heat haze like a mirage.

Eline’s breath hitched.

Kyle’s fingers closed around the moissanite.

Aya’s eyes found them. Held.

For a second, her pupils didn’t dilate. Didn’t react to the light.

Then she smiled.

Too wide. Too perfect.

“You’re early for lunch,” she said.

---

**12:15 – The Longhouse Kitchen**

The duty roster was pinned to the corkboard beside the kettle.

Kyle found it by accident. He was looking for the tonic Eline had mentioned—the one Paula had crushed in the mortar, the one that smelled like poison disguised as medicine. The kettle was cold now, the mugs washed, the counter wiped clean.

But the roster was still there.

A single sheet of bright white paper—*non-commune stock*—among the recycled cream of the retreat’s official documents. The handwriting was neat, precise. Too precise.

And there it was.

*The glitch.*

**“Staff Duty : Longhouse cleanup 12:00–14:00 , Aya + Ingrid”**

The space before the comma.

His pulse spiked.

He ripped the sheet from the board. Folded it. Slid it into his journal.

*12:17 PM. Forensic acquisition:*

*—Duty Roster (Longhouse). Handwritten. Non-commune paper stock (bright white, 80 gsm).*

*—Anomaly: Space-before-comma glitch (identical to Paula’s schedule, Aya’s journal, Dawid’s “evidence”).*

*—Context: Aya assigned to Longhouse cleanup during Bleach Gap (12:00–14:00 PM).*

*—Conflict: Aya observed exiting Western Cottage #2 at 12:03 PM. Impossible to occupy two locations simultaneously.*

*—Hypothesis: Systemic infection. The imposter’s linguistic fingerprint now embedded in administrative documentation.*

He didn’t write the next thought.

*She’s not just mimicking the group.*

*She’s mimicking the* **system**.

The kettle whistled behind him.

He turned.

Eline stood in the doorway, her face pale. She didn’t ask what he’d found. She didn’t need to.

She held out her wrist.

A single drop of liquid glistened there. Dark pink. Sticky.

“Tonic residue,” she said. “From the mug Paula gave me.”

He didn’t touch it.

Didn’t need to.

The scent was already in the air—lilies and something underneath. Something chemical.

Something *wrong*.

“It’s not just on her,” Eline said. “It’s *in* her.”

The birdsong looped.

The sun didn’t move.

And in the distance, the Maypole stood sentinel, its ribbons limp in the still, watching air.

---

* * *

The laundry sheets hung like ghost limbs, swaying in the windless heat. Kyle moved between them, the white linen pressing against his shoulders, his arms, his face—each step forward a brush against something that wasn’t solid but wasn’t air either. The snap-snap-snap of the fabric was the only sound besides the river, a rhythmic counterpoint to his pulse.

*16:03 PM. Western Cottage laundry zone.*

*—Visual obstruction: 87% (white linen sheets, 1.2m spacing, no shadow cast).*

*—Auditory environment: Fabric percussion (3 Hz), river masking (constant 45 dB).*

*—Anomaly: No bird activity. Silence where loop should be.*

He didn’t write the rest.

*The birds are gone.*

The bin was where it always was—beside the wooden trough where the retreat staff soaked the linen in some chemical solution before hanging. A galvanized steel pail, dented at the rim, the lid slightly ajar.

He lifted it.

The scent hit first.

Not lilies. Not perfume. Something sharper. Something *engineered*.

A discarded atomizer bottle lay half-buried under crumpled paper towels. Black plastic, professional grade, the kind used in theatre productions for actors who needed their signature scent to last through three-hour performances without reapplication. The label was peeled off, but the nozzle was still damp.

He picked it up.

The residue on his fingers was tacky. Not oil. Not water.

*Fixative.*

The kind that bonded to skin. The kind that didn’t wash off in sweat.

The kind you used when you needed a mask to stay on for *hours*.

His throat constricted.

*16:07 PM. Forensic acquisition:*

*—Object: Theatrical scent atomizer (black, 120ml, fixative residue present).*

*—Context: Discarded in laundry waste bin. Non-commune item (no Hårga branding, industrial grade).*

*—Implication: Masking agent for prolonged persona maintenance. Explains scent persistence across Paula/Aya transitions.*

*—Question: Why discard now? Schedule deviation? Or—*

A sound.

Not from the bin. Not from the sheets.

From the cottage.

A voice.

Male. Rasped. Distorted.

*"—fucking listen—"*

Dawid’s voice.

Kyle’s body locked.

*16:08 PM. Auditory anomaly:*

*—Dawid vocal signature detected (masculine rasp, voice modulator distortion).*

*—Location: Western Cottage #2.*

*—Conflict: Current time = 16:08 PM (Aya’s operational window). Dawid schedule = 22:00–04:00 PM.*

*—Hypothesis: Collapse of transition protocol. Personas bleeding into single vessel.*

The sun hit the atomizer bottle in his hand.

A prismatic flare—white-hot, instantaneous—seared his retinas.

His vision whited out.

The voice didn’t stop.

*"—no, listen, you don’t get to—"*

Closer now.

The cottage door was open.

A shadow moved inside. Not a shadow—a *figure*. Tall. Broad-shouldered. Flannel sleeves rolled to the elbows.

Dawid.

Here.

Now.

Kyle’s fingers spasmed around the atomizer. The plastic cracked.

The scent exploded into the air—lilies, chemical burn, the stench of something *rotten* underneath.

His stomach lurched.

The Dog Brain took over.

*Too much.*

*Too bright.*

*Too wrong.*

His legs moved before his mind did.

He ran.

Not toward the Longhouse. Not toward the meadow.

Toward the only place without light.

The Root Cellar.

The stairs were a blur. His hands found the door by memory, the wood rough under his palms. He shoved it open, the hinges groaning, and the darkness swallowed him whole.

The air was damp. Cold. The scent of earth and mildew replaced the chemical stench of the atomizer.

He collapsed against the wall.

The bottle was still in his hand.

He brought it to his face.

Inhaled.

The lilies were gone.

In their place: the sharp, metallic tang of the fixative. The *base* of the scent. The thing underneath the mask.

His vision swam.

*16:15 PM. Cognitive collapse:*

*—Symptoms: Optical vertigo (retinal flare afterimage), auditory loop (Dawid vocal signature on repeat), olfactory overload (fixative residue).*

*—Diagnosis: Stage 2 Dog Brain (sensory input rejection).*

*—Treatment: Isolation. Darkness. Tactile anchor.*

His free hand found his pocket.

The moissanite stones were there.

He pulled one out.

Cold. Hard. *Real.*

He pressed it into his palm until the edges bit skin.

The voice was still in his head.

*"Listen."*

No.

*Listen.*

**No.**

He dug his nails into his thigh.

Pain was a language his body understood.

The darkness pressed in.

The stone cut deeper.

The voice faded.

The scent lingered.

He breathed.

In.

Out.

In.

*—The atomizer is the key.*

*—The fixative is the proof.*

*—The schedule is broken.*

Out.

*—She’s not three people.*

*—She’s one.*

*—And she’s falling apart.*

### Chapter 10: The Porcelain Break (Day 8)

The North Gorge at 3:00 PM was not a place. It was a condition—light so total it erased depth, a whiteout horizon where sky and stone bled into one undifferentiated plane.

Mia stood at the edge.

Her breath came fast and shallow. Not from fear. From clarity.

She had followed Aya here after the Maypole circle, where Aya’s voice had slithered through the shared language like oil through water.  

*"We must empty the vessel,"* Aya had whispered, her accent slipping in that strange, stilted way it did—будто she were rehearsing a prayer in a language not her own.  

*"You feel the heat. You feel the weight. You are not meant to carry it. One does not resist when the body must be purified."*

Mia had nodded.

She didn’t question.

The mantra had already taken root: *resonance, release, surrender.*

She’d shed her shoes without being told. Walked barefoot across the baked limestone, each step precise, ritualistic. The rock wasn’t hot. It was beyond temperature. It didn’t scorch. It *absorbed*, pulling heat from the air, from her skin, from her core.

Now she peered down.

There was no drop.

Only light.

The edge was just another patch of blinding white, like the rest of the world. The gorge was invisible. A trap built by overexposure.

Aya stepped behind her.

She didn’t touch her at first.

She stood close—close enough for Mia to smell the floral perfume fused to her linen, close enough to feel the hum of breath on the back of her neck.

*"You remember how it felt,"* Aya murmured, будто she were pulling the words from a well.  

*"When they told you your love was noise. When they said your care was weakness. When Kyle looked at you like a system error in need of correction."*

Mia’s throat tightened.

*"Yes."*

*"And you believed them?"*

*"I didn’t— I didn’t know what to believe. But you do."*

*"Yes,"* said Aya. *"I see the vessel. I see how full it is. You are no longer able to contain it. The container must be emptied so the true self can emerge."*

Mia swayed.

The scent of her sweat—acidic, electric beneath the glare—was the only thing that felt real. Her skin pulled taut over her bones. Her eyes ached. She hadn’t blinked in nearly thirty seconds.

Behind her, Aya raised her hands.

No drama. No rage. No hesitation.

Just positioning.

Her palms flattened against Mia’s shoulder blades, fingers splayed across the taut muscles of her back. The contact was firm. Clinical. The pressure built slowly, evenly—a piston descending.

Mia gasped.

Not in terror. In recognition.

*"This is part of the ritual?"*

*"Yes,"* said Aya. *"The body must be helped. The vessel cannot empty itself."*

The pressure increased.

Mia’s weight shifted.

Her toes curled over the edge.

The stone beneath her heels was polished smooth by wind and water, worn to a glassy sheen that reflected nothing—only light.

She looked down again.

Saw only sky.

Felt the pressure in her spine.

Felt the unbearable fullness in her chest—the grief, the rage, the need to be *seen*—all compressed into a single, searing point.

And then she stepped forward.

Or was pushed.

It didn’t matter.

Her heels slipped.

The limestone gave nothing back.

Her fingers clawed backward, catching the edge.

Nails scraped.

A wet, gritty sound—flesh against stone.

One nail ripped.

She didn’t scream.

She *ascended*.

Then she fell.

The first impact came halfway down.

A jagged promontory jutted from the cliff face, buried in mist. Mia’s right leg snapped at the hip. Her spine shattered at C6.

The sound was not a thud.

It was a *crack*.

Dry.

Ceramic.

Like a porcelain bowl dropped from a great height.

The collision sent a spray of blood into the air—small, atomized droplets that caught the sun and flared neon red before vanishing into the mist. The white linen of her dress fluttered open like a broken petal, then wrapped around her torso as she tumbled.

She didn’t bounce.

She *unraveled*.

An elbow snapped back. Ribs collapsed. Her head twisted at an angle that made no anatomical sense.

She hit a second ledge—smaller, sharper. A rib punctured her lung. Blood bubbled from her mouth.

The current waited below.

Aya watched.

She blinked once.

Twice.

Her face showed no emotion.

Not satisfaction.

Not regret.

Just observation.

Mia’s body struck the base of the falls with three heavy, rhythmic slaps—thump, thump, thump—as it hit submerged stone, then the water.

The river churned white with glacial silt.

For a moment, the current stalled around her.

Foam gathered at the tear in her dress.

Pink.

Fleeting.

Then the water tightened its grip.

Pulled.

Scrubbed.

The body twisted, limbs folding like origami as it spun beneath the surface.

Above, Aya knelt.

She reached into the pocket of her linen and pulled out a small, clear bottle.

Peroxide.

Not medicine.

*Sanitation.*

She unscrewed the cap.

Dropped the bottle onto the limestone.

It shattered.

The liquid spread in a thin, fizzing circle.

*Sacred bubbling.*

The blood from Mia’s torn nail—still caught in the rock—reacted instantly.

It foamed.

Then dissolved.

Aya stood.

She took one last look at the river.

No body.

Just movement.

Just light.

Just the sound of the river doing its work—erasing, carrying, cleansing.

She turned.

Walked back along the limestone path.

Her gait was even.

Her breath steady.

Her hands were clean.

* * *

The foam is white.  

The spot is gone.  

The cloth is pure.  

I am the vessel.  

Aya scrubbed the linen cuff with slow, circular motions, the sponge saturated in lemon-scented peroxide. The blood had been minimal—just a smear where the edge of the limestone caught her hand when she knelt. But contamination was not measured in volume. It was measured in presence.  

She dipped the sponge again.  

The floorboards were bleached pale from years of chemical baths.  

The window was open.  

The light poured in like poured glass.  

No shadows.  

No corners.  

No place to hide.  

She folded the cuff twice.  

Pressed it flat.  

Laid it on the drying rack beside two others—identical, sterile, void.  

Then she sat.  

At the desk.  

On the chair that did not creak.  

Paper before her.  

Pen in hand.  

She pulled a crumpled scrap from her pocket—Mia’s handwriting, lifted from a discarded note two days prior. A grocery list. *Salt. Linen thread. Matches.* The loops were large. The pressure uneven. Sudden spikes of force trailed off into feather-light finishes, as if the writer had begun shouting and ended whispering.  

Aya mimicked it.  

She let her right hand jerk.  

Let the pen skip.  

Let the capital *A* loom too large, as if demanding attention.  

> *i cant stay here any longer*  

> *the light is inside me*  

> *i am too full of it*  

> *it has to go*  

> *i am ascending to the outer circle*  

> *dont look for me*

She hesitated on the final comma.  

Then added the space.  

*a space before , the way she always does,* even when stressed, even when pretending, even when vanishing.  

The glitch remained.  

Consistent.  

Inevitable.  

A fingerprint in the syntax.  

She folded the note twice.  

Slipped it into a plain envelope.  

Wrote nothing on the front.  

It would be found.  

It did not need direction.  

Then she stood.  

The theatrical scent atomizer waited on the shelf—glass bottle, brass nozzle, industrial-grade fixative. She unscrewed the cap. Refilled it from a larger jug marked **LY07 – LILY/FORMALDEHYDE BLEND**. One pump. Two. The mist thickened the air, a visible haze that caught the sun and held it.  

The smell was not floral.  

It was *correction*.  

It erased the river.  

It erased the peroxide reaction.  

It erased the faint iron scent that clung to her fingernails.  

She walked to the mirror.  

Unbuttoned her dress.  

Rolled the flannel shirt over cotton binding.  

Secured it with industrial tape.  

Pulled the beanie low.  

The voice modulator sat in its cradle.  

She powered it on.  

Test phrase: *"Listen."*  

The rasp was perfect.  

No delay.  

No glitch in tone.  

Outside, the sun hung at its lowest arc—still above the treeline, still unrelenting.  

The **Bleach Gap** was ending.  

The **Shadow Shift** had not yet begun.  

There was nowhere to hide.  

No time to pause.  

But she did not need to.  

She was not hiding.  

She was becoming.  

She stepped into the light.  

Let it scorch the edges of her silhouette.  

Let it burn the last trace of warmth from her skin.  

Then she opened the door.  

—

The Longhouse was already full by 20:15.  

Bobi carved a flower into the table with a butter knife.  

Julia watched the doorway.  

Klaudia scanned the Western Cottage from across the meadow.  

Kyle arrived last.  

Moissanite stones in his pocket.  

Journal closed.  

Face still.  

He moved to his usual place—end of the long bench, back to the wall.  

But something was wrong.  

The chair across from him—the one always claimed by Mia—was empty.  

Her spoon lay beside her untouched bowl.  

A single envelope sat at the center of the table, unaddressed.  

Kyle picked it up.  

Opened it.  

Read it.  

Once.  

Then again.  

*"Ascending to the outer circle."*  

*"Too full of light."*  

*"Don’t look for me."*  

And then he saw it.  

The space.  

Before the comma.  

Right there.  

In the middle of the last sentence.  

*a silence where breath should be , a space where none belonged.*

His breath caught.  

Not in grief.  

Not yet.  

In recognition.  

He looked up.  

The sun had not set.  

It hovered—glass-bright, unblinking.  

It lit every thread of the white linen, every speck of dust, every untouched spoon.  

It showed everything.  

And revealed nothing.  

Eline leaned into his space, whispering: *"They say she left during sunset walk. No one saw her go. Only this."*  

Kyle did not reply.  

He folded the note.  

Put it in his journal.  

Laid his hand flat on the table.  

The moissanite stones pressed into his thigh.  

Cold.  

Real.  

Anchored.  

But the horror was not in the death.  

It was in the *efficiency*.  

The bleach.  

The note.  

The scent.  

The silence.  

It was in the fact that Mia had been erased  

not in darkness,  

but in full light,  

with perfect grammar,  

and not a single witness needed.

### Chapter 11: The Holy Erasure,

#### Chapter 11: The Morning of Envy

##### Scene 11.1: The Morning of Envy

The communal table stretched beneath the low sun, a rectangle of liquid light that hurt to look at directly. No shadows. No depth. Just the flat, burning whiteness of the tablecloth catching the 06:00 glare and throwing it back into their faces.

Six place settings.

One empty chair.

At Mia's seat, where her spoon had lain the night before, someone had placed a single white mountain flower. The petals were already wilting in the heat, browning at the edges. The stem had been snapped, not cut.

The silence rang.

Not metaphorically.

The birdsong looped in its mechanical cadence—three notes, pause, three notes—until the sound became a pressure in the skull. Kyle counted. Thirty-seven iterations. Thirty-eight. The loop never varied. Never broke.

Bobi sat two seats down from the flower, hands flat on the table, staring at it.

Julia's fork hovered above untouched porridge.

Eline had her notepad open but had written nothing.

Klaudia watched the doorway.

Kyle pressed the moissanite stones into his thigh through his pocket. The cold travelled up his femur, anchoring him to the bench.

Then Paula entered.

She did not look sad.

She looked *radiant*.

Her blonde wig caught the sun and refracted it. The reading glasses sat high on her nose. The knitted shawl draped over white linen, both garments so clean they appeared to vibrate against the over-exposed air.

She walked to the head of the table.

Placed both palms flat.

Smiled.

"Good morning."

No one responded.

Paula inhaled, slow and deliberate, as if savouring the silence.

"I know you have questions. But before we speak, I want you to understand what you are feeling." She paused, letting the birdsong fill the gap. "This is not grief. This is *envy*."

Bobi flinched.

Paula continued, her voice warm and firm. "Mia has achieved full transparency. She held nothing back. She allowed the light to enter her completely, and when the vessel was full, she ascended to the Outer Circle."

Julia set down her fork. The sound was too loud.

"One does not mourn a vessel that has finally caught the sun," Paula said, her tone shifting into the Imperial Imperative, each word a command disguised as comfort. "One celebrates. One reflects on why one has not yet emptied oneself."

Kyle opened his mouth.

No sound came.

His throat had closed.

Bobi's face crumpled.

Not in sorrow.

In *frustration*.

"Why—" His voice broke. He swallowed. Tried again. "Why wasn't I—pure enough to go with her?"

His hands trembled on the table.

Paula moved to him, placed a hand on his shoulder. "You are still learning to let go, Bobi. But you will. You are so close."

Bobi nodded, tears streaming down his face, but they were not tears of loss. They were tears of *inadequacy*.

Eline wrote a single word in her notepad: **Compete.**

Then the others began.

A woman Kyle didn't know—one of the long-term guests—stood, her face slack with exhaustion. "I'm so happy for her. She was so brave."

Another guest, a man with hollowed eyes, agreed. "She found what we're all looking for."

Julia stared at them.

Klaudia's jaw tightened.

Paula smiled, nodding at each declaration. "Yes. Yes. This is the work. Witnessing each other's ascension and asking ourselves: *What am I still protecting?*"

Bobi wiped his face with the back of his hand. "I want to go next. I want to—"

Paula cut him off gently. "You will. When you are ready. When you have released the last of your resistance."

Kyle gripped the moissanite stones until his knuckles whitened.

Paula reached into her shawl and withdrew a folded piece of paper. Bright white. Non-commune stock.

"Mia left this for us," she said. "A final gift."

She unfolded it.

Held it up.

The handwriting was large, looping, uneven.

Kyle recognized it.

Paula read aloud: *"I can't stay here any longer. The light is inside me. I am too full of it. It has to go. I am ascending to the outer circle. Don't look for me."*

She lowered the note.

"Beautiful," she whispered.

The group murmured agreement.

Kyle's hand shot out. "Let me see it."

Paula's smile didn't falter. She passed the note down the table.

Kyle took it.

Scanned the text.

Found it.

Third line.

*The light is inside me , I am too full of it.*

A space.

Before the comma.

The same glitch.

The same as Paula's morning schedules.

The same as the duty roster.

The same as the reflection prompts.

Kyle looked up. His voice came out hoarse, small, wrong. "This has the same formatting error. The space before the comma. Paula's handouts have it. This has it. Mia didn't—"

Paula sighed.

Not anger.

Pity.

"Kyle is still trapped in the ink," she said, addressing the table, not him. "He cannot see the light behind the letters. He looks for flaws in the vessel instead of the purity it carried."

The group turned to look at him.

Not with hostility.

With *concern*.

Therapeutic concern.

Julia's fork remained suspended.

Eline's pen hovered.

Klaudia's gaze shifted to the window.

Kyle set the note down.

His hands were shaking.

Paula collected the paper, folded it, tucked it back into her shawl. "We will keep this. To remind us of what is possible when we stop defending ourselves."

Then she gestured to the window.

Two facilitators—silent, expressionless—emerged from Mia's cottage carrying white paint and brushes.

They moved with the efficiency of cleaners, not mourners.

One dipped a roller into a bucket.

The other began stripping the bed.

"We are preparing the space for new resonance," Paula explained. "Mia's energy has moved on. The cottage must be cleansed so it can welcome another vessel."

Bobi watched them, his face wet, nodding as if this made perfect sense.

Kyle stood.

The bench scraped.

Paula looked at him. "Where are you going?"

"Root Cellar."

"You haven't eaten."

"I'm not hungry."

Paula's smile thinned. "Isolation is resistance, Kyle."

"Then I'm resisting."

He walked.

The sun followed him across the meadow, a spotlight that would not blink.

Behind him, the facilitators painted the cottage walls.

White on white.

Erasing her.

In full daylight.

* * *

Kyle moved with careful deliberation towards the North Gorge, his footsteps hesitant but driven by necessity. The formidable light of the 2:00 PM sun rendered everything hyper-visible, its rays amplifying the landscape until the usual contrasts dissolved. 

At the edge, the world turned into a deceptive palette of glaring whites. No depths, only hardened, flattened waves of light that shunned secrets. The chasm lay before him, utterly exposed, presenting a perfect lie. Under the sun's merciless gaze, all mystery evaporated with the mist that hung suspended and heavy, mocking him with its obstinate opacity over the churning torrent below.

His eyes scanned the gorge for any trace of Mia, any sign of the encounter that had unfurled there—an echo of rebellion against the sun's sterilizing force. But there was nothing. Only the river thrashing below, so effectively designed to erase, to cleanse and deny. Kyle’s heart beat with a mixture of exasperation and dauntlessness, muscles taut against the fear of being fooled by nature's optical trickery.

As he backed away, a glint of something bone-white against the limestone path snagged his attention. Bending low, Kyle retrieved a shard—a tiny porcelain fragment, sharp and stark against his palm. He knew it immediately as a piece of the bowl that Aya had given Mia—a symbol of transient purity. His hand flexed involuntarily, the shard slipping, slicing his finger. Blood emerged, vivid and jarring—a reckless streak of neon. It shocked him, the sight too bright, too real against the bleached landscape.

His gaze fell on the trickle of red, awe mingled with revulsion, as if the land itself had been offended by this intrusion of color. The porcelain, though inert in its state, forged a bridge to the truth amid an environment that seemed bent on seducing him into blindness.

The wind chose that moment to shift, carrying with it a cloying thickness that enveloped him. It was unmistakably Paula's—or Aya’s—lily-perfumed legacy. Haunted by scent, the air felt artificial, stage-managed, the natural crash of water temporarily stifled by this manufactured embrace. Kyle's nostrils flared, inhaling this intrusive olfactory ghost that seemed designed to mask reality with its florid presence. Doubt crept like static into his skull, unsettling him as the river struggled to reassert its voice over the perfume’s dominion.

Combating the discord within, Kyle unfurled his journal, intent on capturing his revelation—on anchoring himself with ink. He touched the page lightly with his pen and tried: *Aya killed Mia*. 

But the paper seemed electrified, bouncing the sunlight into his eyes until the veins and fibers ceased to exist, lines veiled by a harsh white that invaded his senses. He blinked, breathed deep, able to see neither word nor line. The imposing luminescence did not blur the world. Instead, it crushed cohesion with its unwavering brilliance, eliminating meaning.

His tongue felt like sandpaper in his mouth as he fumbled with the words that seemed to vanish beneath his script. His Forensic Gaze, once so adept at peeling apart truths from tangled facades, faltered. The abyss between certainty and uncertainty deepened, the light amplifying his paranoia until only fidelity to his own mind remained twisted in certainty.

Desperation clawed at him as the realization settled like lead: his perception was being undone by the light itself. Here, under this unerring assault, even the most resolute records seemed made of smoke. The harder he tried to fix his understanding, the more it disintegrated. A creeping dog brain onset blunted his reason, leaving him flailing as the past and potential consequences ghosted just out of reach.

The sun, relentless and always watching, had now become part of the lie—its brilliance a profound obstruction, a saboteur cloaked in glory. Perspiration slicked his palms as the paper slipped slightly between his fingers. Just then, the river chose to roar once more, serenade of chaos following him as Kyle forced himself away from the edge, back into the embrace of the forest with its pulsing, shadowless clarity.

### Chapter 12: The Trial of the Disembodied

The Longhouse, a structure that once epitomized communal sanctuary, had become a crucible of psychological undoing. At its heart stood Aya, her figure sharply defined against the onslaught of light pouring in through the high windows. The sun's rays, unencumbered by clouds or mercy, sliced through the space, casting long, white bars across the wooden floor. Each line of brilliance seemed to sever another tie to reason, inviting a collective madness to take root in the hearts of those gathered within.

As the group settled into their seats, the air hung heavy with the scent of lilies. It was a floral assault, a contrived fragrance meant to anchor the perfidy that was about to unfold. The Theatrical Scent filled the room, cloying and persistent, refusing to be ignored or forgotten. It was the olfactory equivalent of a stage curtain, signaling the commencement of a performance that would blur the lines between reality and spectacle.

Aya began to move with an eerie precision that was not her own. Her hand twitched upward, fingers splayed, and tapped a rhythm against her collarbone—a beat that was unmistakably Mia's. The cadence was a staccato 4/4, a nervous tic that Mia had displayed in moments of heightened emotion. The group watched, their collective fatigue and the insidious erosion of their cognitive faculties rendering them incapable of resistance. They were malleable putty in Aya's hands, gasping in unison as she embodied the woman they had lost.

Bobi, a man who had always teetered on the edge of emotional precipices, crumbled before the performance. His eyes widened, and a look of profound anguish twisted his features. He dropped to his knees, hands clasped tightly together as if in prayer. To Bobi, it was not Aya who stood before him, but a spectral echo of Mia. Aya-as-Mia spoke, her voice infused with the aggression and intensity that had once been Mia's hallmark. She accused Kyle, her words a harsh indictment that painted him as a parasite who had drained her essence with his relentless logic.

In a display of chilling versatility, Aya shifted seamlessly into the persona of Paula. Her posture straightened, and her voice took on a matronly timbre. She spoke of the need to cleanse the data set, to remove the interference that was Kyle. She did not label him a murderer, but rather, a disruptor, an anomaly of "Static Interference" that threatened the integrity of their collective truth. Her language was laced with the imperious certainty that had come to define Paula, compelling the group to heed her directives without question.

Aya reached into the folds of her white linen dress and produced a black landline phone. It was an archaic thing, its cord a physical umbilical to a "fake" truth. With a flourish that was both theatrical and grotesque, she dialed a number and held the receiver to her ear. The sound that emanated from the earpiece was a grating, distorted echo—the voice of the Blocked Girl. The words were cold, calculated, and cruel, listing Kyle's supposed crimes with the detachment of a recording. The voice, compressed and artificial, spoke of emotional data theft, of manipulation, and of a cruelty so profound that it required the purging of its source.

As the voice on the phone faded into silence, the group began to chant. It was a low, sonorous sound that resonated through the Longhouse with a disquieting power. They called out Kyle's name, not in outrage, but as a mantra, a litany meant to expunge him from their midst. The vibrations of their collective voice seemed to merge with the omnipresent hum of the Midnight Sun, creating a symphony of erasure.

Kyle stood motionless in a bar of blinding light, the stark illumination rendering him both hyper-visible and utterly inconsequential. The chanting continued, each repetition of his name stripping away another layer of his identity. He was no longer the unofficial leader, the architect of their once-cohesive social circle. He was a ghost, an echo of a person, drained of substance by the relentless incantation of his own name.

For a fleeting moment, Kyle considered breaking his self-imposed silence, to shatter the illusion with the truth that Aya was nothing more than a skilled imposter. But as the chanting swelled and the scent of lilies grew ever more oppressive, he realized the futility of such an action. His voice, once a beacon of reason in the chaos of his world, would be swallowed by the chorus of madness that now filled the Longhouse.

The light that streamed through the high windows seemed to pulse with a life of its own, each beat in sync with the group's hypnotic mantra. It was as if the sun itself had become a participant in the ritual, its ceaseless glow aiding in the orchestrated unraveling of Kyle's existence.

As the sun began its slow descent toward the horizon, its rays softened, casting a golden hue that belied the darkness of the act taking place within the Longhouse. The group's chanting reached a crescendo, and then, as suddenly as it had begun, it ceased. In the sudden silence, Kyle felt the weight of a thousand unseen eyes upon him, stripping him bare, leaving him exposed and vulnerable in a way he had never imagined possible.

Aya, now fully in control, offered him a look of pity—a mockery of compassion that chilled him to his core. She stepped forward, breaking the plane of light that had, until that moment, been his unwilling ally. With the entire group watching in rapt attention, she extended her hand toward him, her fingers curled as if to grasp the very essence of his being.

Kyle, recognizing the gesture for the dismissal it was, turned on his heel and walked away. Each step he took was deliberate, a silent affirmation of his refusal to succumb to the collective delusion that had enveloped the group. He moved through the bars of sunlight, their harshness a stark reminder of the reality he now faced alone.

As he reached the threshold of the Longhouse, the scent of lilies clung to him, a stubborn reminder of the charade he had just escaped. He stepped out into the open air, the fading sunlight casting long shadows across the wildflower meadow. The sight of the western cottages, their windows reflecting the dying light, served as a painful reminder of the fractured lives that lay within.

With the group's chant still echoing in his ears, Kyle made his way to the Root Cellar—a place of darkness and solitude that stood in stark contrast to the relentless brightness of the world above. He descended the worn stone steps, the cool, dank air enveloping him like a shroud. In the shadows of the cellar, he allowed himself to acknowledge the fear that gnawed at his resolve.

But as he sat there, surrounded by the crushing silence, a spark of determination flickered to life within him. He would not allow Aya's deception to go unchallenged. He would gather the evidence, expose the lies, and reveal the true nature of the horror that had befallen them all.

As the last traces of daylight receded from the sky, Kyle took out his journal and began to write. His hand moved across the page with a newfound urgency, each word a testament to his unwavering commitment to the truth. The darkness of the Root Cellar, once a symbol of his isolation, now became his sanctuary—a place where he could plan his next move away from the prying eyes of the sun.

And so, as the Midnight Sun gave way to the brief respite of twilight, Kyle prepared for the fight of his life. He would confront the imposter, strip away her masks, and restore order to the chaos that Aya had wrought. For in the end, it was not the light that held the power, but the truth that lay hidden within the shadows.

---

* * *

The Root Cellar lay beneath the Longhouse, a subterranean chamber of limestone and shadows. It was the antithesis of the world above—a realm where the Midnight Sun's relentless gaze could not penetrate. Here, the only light came from a single, high-wattage surgical bulb that hung from the ceiling, casting stark, clinical illumination over the earthen floor and the man bound to a white wooden chair.

Kyle sat motionless, his posture a portrait of resigned defiance. The light above him, intense and unyielding, seemed to strip away more than just the darkness; it peeled back layers of certainty, leaving him exposed to the harsh reality of his situation. He was a captive in a place that was supposed to be his refuge, his sanctuary from the madness that had consumed the retreat.

The heavy wooden door creaked open, and Dawid stepped into the cellar. His presence filled the room, a looming shadow that blocked out the light as he approached. He was the cleaner, the enforcer, the final piece of Aya's fractured persona that had orchestrated the unraveling of Kyle's life. His raw, masculine rasp cut through the silence, a stark contrast to the modulated voice that had echoed through the Longhouse only hours before.

"Kyle," Dawid said, his voice a low growl that seemed to resonate with the very stones of the cellar. "You've been busy."

He flipped open Kyle's journal, the pages filled with meticulous notes and observations—a record of the truth as Kyle had come to understand it. Dawid's fingers, calloused and unyielding, traced the lines of text, pausing every so often to highlight a particular inconsistency.

"You're starting to write like us, Kyle," Dawid taunted, his eyes gleaming with sadistic pleasure. "будто you’re finally becoming a vessel."

Kyle's gaze flickered to the page, where the telltale space-before-comma glitch seemed to mock him. It was the same anomaly he had discovered in the documents and handouts distributed by Paula and Aya. The same anomaly that now marred his own notes, a symptom of the psychological warfare he had been subjected to.

Dawid circled the chair, a predator toying with its prey. He did not raise a hand to strike Kyle; there would be no physical battering, no bruises to bear witness to the violence that had occurred within these stone walls. Instead, Dawid reached for the high-intensity lamp that stood on a wooden table beside Kyle.

With deliberate cruelty, Dawid adjusted the lamp, positioning it inches from Kyle's eyes. The light was blinding, a white-hot brilliance that seared his retinas and turned the world into a blazing haze of color and shadow. It was a form of torture far more insidious than any blow could deliver—a relentless assault on the senses designed to break the mind while leaving the body untouched.

Kyle blinked against the light, his eyes watering as he struggled to maintain his composure. The light was all-consuming, a physical presence that seemed to fill his every pore, leaving no room for thought, no space for reason. It was as if Dawid were attempting to bleach his mind, to strip away the layers of logic and intellect that had always been Kyle's armor against the chaos of the world.

As the hours passed, the relentless illumination took its toll. Kyle's thoughts began to fragment, his perception of reality warping under the onslaught of the light. The "Blocked Girl" narrative, once a clear example of Aya's manipulation, now seemed to blend with his own memories. Had she truly been nothing more than a fabrication, a tool used to sow discord among the group? Or was she a victim, just like Mia, consumed by the retreat's insatiable hunger for transparency and vulnerability?

The light is the truth, Kyle thought, his mind caught in a loop of inescapable logic. The dark is the lie. I am the noise. I must be silent.

With each passing moment, Kyle felt himself slipping further into what he recognized as Stage 3—the Dog Brain. His thoughts became simplified, stripped of nuance and complexity. The world around him was reduced to a series of biological states, the harsh light above him a reminder of the reality he could no longer deny.

The dust motes in the air, illuminated by the surgical bulb, seemed to dance before his eyes—a swirling maelstrom of particles that mocked him with their freedom of movement. Kyle's eyes followed their erratic paths, the effort of tracking them a welcome distraction from the pain of the light.

Dawid watched from the shadows, his face obscured by the glare of the lamp. He had become the embodiment of Kyle's downfall—a specter of doubt that had burrowed its way into the very core of Kyle's being. And as the night wore on, with the light showing no signs of abating, Kyle knew that his only hope of survival lay in his ability to endure, to hold onto the truth even as the world around him crumbled into a cacophony of lies and illusions.

The Root Cellar, once a place of safety, had become his crucible—a chamber where the dross of deception would be burned away, leaving behind only the purest form of truth. And as the first hints of dawn began to pierce the darkness above, Kyle realized that his battle was far from over. The light may have been his enemy, but it was also his ally—a beacon that would guide him back to the world he had once known, a world where facts and evidence still held the power to illuminate the darkness.

As Dawid finally extinguished the light and left Kyle alone in the dimming glow of the surgical bulb, a sense of calm descended upon the cellar. Kyle's breathing slowed, his mind quieted, and in the stillness that followed, he made a silent vow to expose the lies that had taken root at Hårga Retreat Center.

For he knew, with a clarity that belied the chaos of his thoughts, that the true horror of the retreat lay not in the darkness of the Root Cellar, but in the blinding light of the Midnight Sun—a light that had revealed the depths of human depravity and the fragile nature of truth itself.

### Chapter 13

The Longhouse stood silent and oppressive under the weight of the relentless sun, which now hung at its lowest point in the sky, casting a pale, sickly gold across the landscape. It was 02:00, a time when shadows should have been long and dark, but instead, they stretched across the ground like grotesque parodies of their daylight selves—distorted, elongated, and somehow profoundly wrong.

In the meadow, the group sat in a circle, their bodies arranged with geometric precision that bordered on the obsessive. Each person was positioned equidistant from the next, a perfect symmetry that seemed to mock the chaos of their fractured minds. They were in the grip of **Stage 3: Dog Brain**, a state of cognitive collapse that had reduced their conversation to the most basic of sentences, stripped of all complexity and nuance.

Bobi sat with his legs crossed, his eyes fixed unblinkingly on the horizon where the sun hovered in its deathless arc. His lips moved almost imperceptibly as he hummed a single, flat note that seemed to resonate with the distant murmur of the river. It was a sound that was neither harmonious nor discordant, but rather a neutral sonic presence that filled the void left by the absence of meaningful dialogue.

Dawid emerged from the Longhouse, his figure backlit by the sun so that he appeared as a dark silhouette against the brightness. He moved through the group with a quiet, measured grace, his voice barely above a whisper as he issued his "corrections." He did not shout. He did not need to. The power of his words was not in their volume, but in their content.

He knelt beside Bobi, his voice a low rumble that seemed to vibrate in the very air around them. "Your memories of Mia are corrupted files," he said, his words slicing through the stillness like a scalpel. "It feels as if you never knew her, будто she was only a dream the light gave you."

Bobi's humming faltered for a moment, but then resumed with a newfound intensity, as if the very act of breathing life into that single note was an act of defiance against the erasure of his past.

Meanwhile, in the corner of the meadow, Eline sat beneath the glare of a high-wattage lamp, her eyes bloodshot and her hands trembling as she leafed through her clinical notes. She was re-categorizing them, arranging and re-arranging them according to the "comma glitch" that had become an obsession—a beacon of truth in a world that had been turned upside down.

In her hand, she held a mechanical pencil, its tip pressed against the soft flesh of her forearm. Over and over again, she etched the glitch into her skin, a physical manifestation of the cognitive dissonance that had taken root in her mind. The pain was sharp and immediate, a stark contrast to the numbing unreality that surrounded her. To her, the "error" was now the only "truth."

Julia and Klaudia sat side by side, their bodies swaying gently in time with the rhythm of the river. They tried to speak, to share their fears and observations, but the "ringing silence" of the resort was too loud, a cacophony of nothingness that drowned out all attempts at communication.

As they looked into each other's eyes, they experienced a profound sense of disorientation—a **Visual Vertigo** that caused their faces to blur and shift before their eyes. The lines between "investigator" and "subject" had become irrevocably blurred, and they could no longer remember who was who, or what their purpose had been.

Dawid stood and addressed the group, his voice carrying an air of finality that cut through the fog of their collective stupor. "It is time for a 'Midnight Wash,'" he announced, gesturing toward the river with its ice-cold waters that flowed relentlessly beneath the unyielding gaze of the sun. "We will scrub the noise from our skin and purify our vessels."

The group rose as one, their movements synchronized and robotic as they followed Dawid down to the river's edge. There was no protest, no hesitation—only a peaceful, almost serene acceptance of the ritual that awaited them.

The horror of the situation lay not in the act itself, but in their total compliance, their willingness to submit to the will of the man who had orchestrated their collective downfall. They waded into the water without a word, their white linen garments billowing out around them like spectral apparitions.

As they scrubbed their skin with the coarse river sand, their faces upturned to the sun, a sense of profound emptiness settled over the scene. The Midnight Sun, once a celestial body to be revered, had become an oppressive force—a relentless observer that bore witness to their total and utter capitulation.

And as the first hints of dawn began to creep across the sky, signaling the end of Dawid's window, the group emerged from the river, their bodies cleansed but their spirits irrevocably tainted by the events that had unfolded under the watchful eye of the sun.

The light, which had once promised clarity and understanding, had instead delivered them into a world of shadows and doubt—a world where truth and lies had become indistinguishable from one another, and where the only certainty was the relentless passage of time.

As they made their way back to the Longhouse, their footsteps heavy and their eyes vacant, it was clear that the retreat had become something far more sinister than any of them could have imagined. It was no longer a sanctuary for healing and introspection, but rather a prison—a place where the very fabric of their identities had been systematically unraveled, leaving behind only the hollowed-out shells of who they once were.

The sun continued its relentless journey across the sky, oblivious to the suffering that unfolded beneath its golden gaze. And as the group settled back into their places in the meadow, their bodies arranged with clinical precision, they waited in silence for the next phase of their ordeal to begin.

For in this place, where the sun never set and the shadows never fell, the true horror lay not in the darkness, but in the light—a light that revealed the depths of their vulnerabilities and the fragility of their minds. And as they sat there, lost in their own private hells, they knew that the days ahead would test the very limits of their endurance.

The Midnight Sun, in all its blinding intensity, had become their jailer—a celestial warden that watched over them with an unblinking eye, ensuring that their every move was observed and recorded. And as the minutes ticked by with agonizing slowness, they understood that there would be no escape—no respite from the relentless scrutiny that had become their new reality.

In the end, all they could do was wait—wait for the sun to dip below the horizon, wait for the darkness to bring them a measure of peace, wait for the dawn to break and the cycle to begin anew. For in this world, where the light never faded and the shadows never grew, time had become both their enemy and their only hope of salvation.

And as the sun reached the zenith of its arc, casting its golden light over the retreat for another endless day, they knew that their struggle was far from over. The battle for their sanity—for their very souls—had only just begun.

#### Chapter 13 - Scene 2: The Temporal Glitch

**4 Beats**

**Time:** 04:00 – 06:00 (Transition Window: Dawid to Paula)

**Setting:** The Root Cellar, lit by a single, unblinking surgical bulb.

**Beat 1: The Sensory Cage**

In the claustrophobic confinement of the Root Cellar, Kyle's world had shrunk to the dimensions of his own mind. The relentless hum of the lightbulb above him served as a metronome, marking the passage of time in an endless loop of sound that he could neither escape nor ignore. He was no longer "Kyle," a person with thoughts, feelings, and a life that extended beyond these four walls. Instead, he had become a "data point," a singular piece of information catalogued and stored within the confines of his own fractured psyche.

The "Optical Fatigue" induced by the Midnight Sun had leached all color from his vision, leaving him with a flat, gray-scale map of the world that was as devoid of warmth as it was of compassion. The light had stripped away his ability to discern nuance and depth, rendering his surroundings in harsh contrasts that offered no comfort, no solace, and no hope.

**Beat 2: The Acoustic Leak**

As Kyle sat in the grip of his sensory cage, his heightened state of awareness picked up on the subtle cues that filtered down through the floorboards of the Root Cellar. There was a moment, fleeting and yet as distinct as the changing of the guard, when the heavy boots of Dawid ceased their incessant pacing. A silence followed, thick and oppressive, lasting exactly twelve minutes. And then, the "clack" of the voice modulator being deactivated—a sound that had become as familiar to Kyle as his own heartbeat.

In the silence that ensued, the soft, rhythmic "tap-tap" of Paula’s maternal heels echoed through the space—a stark contrast to the gruff, authoritative presence that had preceded it. The transition was seamless, a carefully orchestrated performance that adhered to a schedule as rigid and unyielding as the light itself.

**Beat 3: The Logical Spark**

Despite the cognitive suppression imposed by the "Dog Brain" stage, a spark of logical thought managed to ignite within the recesses of Kyle's mind. The twelve minutes of silence—a temporal gap that had gone unnoticed until now—suddenly took on a new significance. It was the exact amount of time required to traverse the distance from the Longhouse to the Western Cottages, to shed one persona and don another in a meticulously choreographed ritual that had been repeated day after day, without fail.

The realization struck Kyle with the force of a revelation. The group of leaders that he had perceived as separate entities was, in fact, a single individual bound by a **performance schedule** that was as precise as it was unforgiving. The personas of Paula, Aya, and Dawid were not coexisting within the same temporal space; they were sequential, each occupying their designated window of time with robotic precision.

**Beat 4: The Anchor of Truth**

It was in this moment of clarity that Kyle's hand brushed against something metallic and familiar lying discarded on the cold, hard ground. His mechanical pen—a tool of logic and rational thought that had served him well in his former life—felt like a lifeline in a world that had become increasingly unmoored from reality.

With trembling fingers, he picked up the pen and began to sketch a **Temporal Grid** on the back of his leather journal. 06:00 was marked for Paula, the nurturing caregiver who preached radical transparency. 12:00 belonged to Aya, the master manipulator who wove her narratives with the finesse of a seasoned puppeteer. And finally, 22:00 was the domain of Dawid, the enforcer whose ruthless tactics had brought the group to its knees.

The grid laid bare the truth that Kyle had been too blind to see: The "Imposter" was not free to roam the retreat at will. She was a prisoner—a captive of her own elaborate deception, bound by a schedule that was dictated by the relentless cycle of the Midnight Sun. This was the breakthrough that Kyle had been searching for—a glimmer of hope in the face of overwhelming darkness.

The sun never sets at Hårga, but the masks must change. This simple truth, once obscured by layers of manipulation and deceit, now stood as an unassailable fact—a cornerstone upon which Kyle could begin to rebuild his shattered sense of self.

As the first hints of dawn began to seep into the Root Cellar, casting long, angular shadows across the room, Kyle felt the grip of the "Dog Brain" begin to loosen. The relentless march of time, once his adversary, had now become his greatest ally. For with each passing second, he was drawing closer to the moment when he would finally confront the architect of his despair and expose the lies that had held them all captive for so long.

With newfound resolve, Kyle began to formulate a plan. He would use the "Temporal Grid" as his guide, exploiting the weaknesses in the "Imposter's" schedule to gather the evidence he needed to bring her reign of terror to an end. It would not be easy, and it would not be without risk, but for the first time since his arrival at the retreat, Kyle felt a sense of purpose—a conviction that he could, and would, restore order to the chaos that had consumed their lives.

As the light from the surgical bulb flickered and danced across the surface of his sketched grid, Kyle allowed himself a moment of cautious optimism. The game of cat and mouse that had defined his existence at Hårga was far from over, but he had found his anchor—his anchor of truth—and with it, the strength to fight back against the oppressive forces that sought to define his reality.

The "Imposter" may have controlled the narrative thus far, but Kyle was determined to reclaim his story—one beat at a time.

### Chapter 14: The Temporal Breach

#### Chapter 14 - Scene 1: The Twelve-Minute Gap

The mechanical watch pressed against Kyle's wrist like a heartbeat. 05:48. He counted breaths—four seconds in, six seconds out—each cycle a reassertion of autonomy in a world that had systematically stripped it away. The Root Cellar's darkness offered no comfort, only contrast to the surgical brightness that would greet him above. His mind operated with the crystalline precision of Stage 1 thinking, the Dog Brain obliterated by purpose. He didn't catalogue fear or uncertainty. He catalogued data: twelve minutes from boot-fall to heel-click, the exact duration required for one vessel to empty itself and refill with another identity.

The Clinical Coldness settled over him like armour.

Above, the heavy thud of Dawid's boots struck the floorboards in measured rhythm. Kyle's breath synchronized to the pattern—left foot, right foot, pause at the threshold. Then came the sound he'd been waiting for: the specific click-hiss of electronic equipment powering down. The voice modulator, that mechanical larynx that had transformed a woman's vocal cords into masculine authority, went silent. Not the silence of absence, but the silence of **System Shutdown**—a technological exhale before the next boot sequence began.

For the next twelve minutes, the Imposter would not exist.

Kyle stood. His legs protested, muscles atrophied from confinement, but he forced them into compliance. The cellar door loomed before him, heavy wood that had held him captive for days. His hand found the latch and pushed.

It swung open without resistance.

No lock. No bolt. The door had never been secured by metal or mechanism, only by the group's collective conviction that he belonged in darkness, that his guilt required containment. The realization didn't spark anger—anger was inefficient—but it crystallized his understanding of how thoroughly perception had been weaponized at Hårga. The door opened because the prison had always been psychological, not physical.

The 06:00 glare struck him like a fist. The sun hung low on the horizon yet blazed with the intensity of noon, casting no shadows, offering no gradation between light and not-light. Kyle's pupils contracted violently. He pressed his palm against the doorframe, using the rough wood as a tactile anchor whilst his vision adjusted to the assault.

The Western Path stretched before him, a limestone corridor between the Longhouse and the three isolated cottages. Kyle moved low and deliberate, each footfall placed with surgical care to minimize sound. The white birch trees flanking the path created vertical lines that repeated endlessly, a barcode of nature that his exhausted visual cortex struggled to parse. He forced his gaze forward, tracking the path's destination.

Forty metres ahead, evidence of metamorphosis.

A porcelain basin sat outside Cottage 9, filled with grey water that caught the light like liquid metal. The surface rippled with dissolved pigment—theatrical makeup, dirt, the physical residue of masculinity scrubbed away in preparation for the Moralist's emergence. Beside the basin, a flannel shirt lay crumpled and discarded, still holding the shape of the body that had worn it hours before.

Kyle crept closer. The blonde wig hung from the cottage railing like a scalped trophy, its synthetic fibres catching the breeze and creating the illusion of breath. The hairpiece had been positioned deliberately, aligned to dry in the sun's path, and Kyle noted the clinical efficiency of the placement. No wasted movement. No unnecessary exposure. The operator maintained her schedule with the precision of software executing its runtime.

His breath stilled.

Through the cottage window, backlit by the punishing brightness that eliminated depth and detail, a figure moved. The silhouette stripped away the flannel shirt—Kyle watched the fabric slide down arms he couldn't see, revealing nothing but bleached outline against bleached background. The figure's movements carried rehearsed fluidity, muscle memory perfected through repetition. Hands reached up to remove the chest binding, unwinding the compression fabric with methodical care.

The white linen dress emerged next, pulled over a head rendered featureless by the solar glare. The transformation occurred in absolute silence, no sound penetrating the cottage walls, only the visual evidence of one identity dissolving into another.

Kyle's watch read 05:56.

Four minutes remained before Paula would emerge, before the Moralist would descend upon the meadow to lead the morning wellness practice with her Imperial Imperative and uncanny-valley cadence. Four minutes before the operator locked herself back into the performance schedule that governed her existence as absolutely as it had governed his captivity.

The figure in the window adjusted the wig with both hands, fingers working to position synthetic blonde strands into a practical bun. Kyle saw no face, no features, only the **Bleached Outline** of a body engaged in ritual preparation. The operator smoothed the white linen over her torso, each gesture deliberate and necessary, before reaching for reading glasses that would alter the geometry of her face.

The sun pressed against Kyle's back, throwing his shadow forward—or it would have, if shadows existed in this latitude during Midsommar week. Instead, the light simply passed through him, rendering him as transparent as the figure in the window, both of them prisoners of the Midnight Sun's relentless exposure.

He understood it then, with the clarity that only comes from witnessing another captive prepare for their performance: the operator was as trapped as he had been. Her prison wasn't a Root Cellar but a calendar, a clock, a schedule that permitted no deviation. She couldn't freely move through the retreat. She could only exist in designated windows, bound by the sun's position and the group's expectations.

05:58.

Kyle retreated six steps, then twelve, placing distance between himself and the cottage before Paula could emerge and the Moralist could resume her governance of the morning. His mechanical watch ticked forward, each second a reminder that time—once his enemy—had become his greatest weapon.

#### Chapter 14: The Temporal Breach - Scene 2

The birch forest swallowed Kyle whole.

He moved between the trees with mechanical precision, each step calculated to minimize sound against the carpet of fallen leaves. The trunks rose around him in endless repetition—white bark peeling in horizontal strips, black scars marking where branches had fallen years before. The sun angled through the canopy at six degrees above the horizon, low enough to create a Strobe Effect as Kyle passed between the vertical lines.

Light. Dark. Light. Dark. Light.

His visual cortex struggled to process the rapid alternation. The world flattened into geometric absolutes, depth collapsing into a barcode that scrolled past him with each forward step. Kyle's pupils dilated and contracted in violent cycles, attempting to adapt to brightness that changed every half-second. The pain manifested behind his eyes, a pressure that built with each optical shift.

He stopped. Pressed his palm against the nearest trunk. The bark felt papery and cool, texture providing the sensory anchor his vision could not. Kyle counted his breaths—four in, six out—until the nausea receded.

The forest stretched in every direction with identical geometry. No landmarks differentiated one section from another. Only white trunks and gold light and the endless mechanical birdsong that looped from speakers he couldn't locate.

Movement ahead.

Kyle froze, his hand still against the tree. Through the strobing vertical lines, a figure moved with the slow, deliberate gait of someone gathering. White linen dress. Bare feet on the forest floor. Arms extended to pluck something from the undergrowth.

Eline.

She crouched beside a patch of white flowers, her fingers moving with exaggerated care as she collected stems one by one. No basket. She simply held them in her left hand whilst her right continued harvesting, each movement isolated and complete before the next began. Her clinical notepad was gone. Her slate-grey clothing was gone. Only the white linen remained, grass-stained at the hem where she'd knelt.

Kyle approached without speaking, watching her profile for recognition. Eline's eyes tracked the flowers with unblinking focus. Her lips moved soundlessly, counting perhaps, or reciting something only she could hear.

"Eline."

She turned. Her pupils were fixed at maximum dilation despite the harsh light, two black voids that swallowed the surrounding iris. No startle response. No surprise. Only the slow mechanical rotation of her head to face the stimulus.

"Kyle."

His name emerged flat, a label assigned to a familiar shape. Eline blinked once, slowly, like a system process completing. She extended her hand, offering a white flower with five petals arranged in perfect radial symmetry.

"The resonance is quiet today."

Kyle stared at the flower. At Eline's unchanging expression. At the way her hand remained extended without tremor or adjustment, as if she'd continue holding that position indefinitely until he accepted or rejected the offering.

"Eline, do you know where you are?"

"The forest. Paula needs herbs for the morning tonic." Eline glanced down at the stems in her left hand, counting silently. "Seven more. Then I return to the Longhouse."

The words carried no inflection, no personality. Subject-verb-object construction with zero linguistic complexity. Kyle recognized the syntax immediately—Stage 3: Dog Brain. Eline's cognitive architecture had collapsed under the sleep deprivation and constant light, reducing her to basic input-output processes. Observe stimulus. Execute programmed response. Return to neutral state.

"When did you last sleep?"

Eline's gaze drifted past him, focusing on something in the middle distance. "Sleep is resistance. Paula teaches us to trust the light."

Kyle took the flower from her hand. Eline's arm lowered with mechanical precision, returning to her side as if spring-loaded. She turned back to the undergrowth, resuming her harvest without acknowledging his continued presence.

He watched her pluck another stem. Add it to her collection. Move three steps deeper into the forest. Crouch. Repeat.

The white birch trunks surrounded them in vertical prison bars. Kyle's eyes traced their patterns, searching for differentiation, finding none. The forest extended in every direction with algorithmic consistency. No trail markers. No broken branches to indicate passage. Only the endless barcode of white and gold that created the illusion of infinite depth whilst offering zero navigational data.

Panic touched the edge of his awareness.

Kyle forced it back, compartmentalized the sensation, and focused on Forensic Anchors. The river existed somewhere to the north—he'd heard its distant roar from the Root Cellar. If he could locate the sound, he could triangulate his position relative to the retreat. But the birdsong drowned everything, that mechanical loop of chirps and trills that created a wall of acoustic white noise.

His left hand throbbed.

The porcelain cut from the North Gorge had reopened during his escape from the cellar, blood seeping through the makeshift bandage he'd fashioned from his shirt. Kyle unwrapped the cloth and examined the wound. The slice ran diagonal across his palm, clean-edged and deep enough to expose subcutaneous fat.

Pain clarified.

He pressed his thumb against the wound's edge, applying pressure until the sensation sharpened from dull ache to bright agony. The discomfort anchored him, pulling his attention away from the strobing trees and Eline's vacant eyes and the impossible sameness of the forest. This was real. Verifiable. A physical fact his body could not deny.

Kyle rewrapped his palm, using the pain as a metronome to maintain cognitive rhythm. He studied the forest floor, searching for deviations in the organic matter. There—a patch where leaves had been disturbed, scattered in a pattern inconsistent with wind. Footprints, perhaps. Or the passage of something dragged.

He followed the disturbance ten metres east, where he found a cluster of stones arranged in a semicircle. The surfaces had been scrubbed clean, no lichen or moss clinging to their faces. Kyle crouched beside them, noting how the arrangement faced southwest toward the retreat. Not natural. Deliberately positioned.

A marker.

The realization spread through him with cold certainty. Someone had created navigational anchors throughout the forest—stones, disturbed earth, specific tree scars. Forensic breadcrumbs for those who knew to look. Kyle traced the pattern, finding another scrubbed stone twelve metres further, then another beyond that.

Behind him, Eline continued her harvest, oblivious.

The high-pitched ringing cut through the birdsong like a blade through silk.

Kyle's head snapped toward the sound. The morning bell, distant but unmistakable, resonated from the direction of the Glass Pavilion. Paula had begun her session. The Moralist would be standing before the assembled group now, delivering her Imperial Imperative whilst the exhausted participants nodded with Dog Brain compliance.

The bell rang three times. Stopped. The mechanical birdsong resumed its loop.

Kyle stood in the white birch forest, technically Outside, technically free from the Root Cellar's confinement. But the trees stretched endlessly in every direction, their vertical barcode creating a cage far larger and more disorienting than any locked door. The sun blazed overhead with surgical intensity, eliminating shadows, flattening depth, rendering the forest into a two-dimensional maze where every direction looked identical to the last.

Eline emerged from the undergrowth behind him, her collection complete. She walked past without acknowledgment, heading southwest along the path marked by scrubbed stones. Her bare feet made no sound against the forest floor.

Kyle watched her disappear into the strobing light, swallowed by the white trees and gold glare.

The wound in his palm throbbed.

He pressed his thumb against it again, using the pain to anchor himself, and began counting steps toward the river he could not yet hear.

### Chapter 15: The Fractured Vessel (Day 11)

Kyle emerged from the Root Cellar at 05:48, tracking the twelve-minute window when the Imposter transforms between identities. He moved along the Western Path towards Cottage 9, where he observed evidence of the transformation: a basin of grey water, discarded flannel shirt, and a blonde wig drying on the railing. Through the cottage window, he watched a backlit figure strip away masculine disguise and don the white linen dress and wig of Paula the Moralist. At 05:58, Kyle retreated before Paula emerged to lead morning wellness practice.

  Kyle navigated through a disorienting birch forest, searching for navigational markers. He encountered Eline, who had regressed to Stage 3: Dog Brain, mechanically collecting white flowers for Paula. Kyle discovered scrubbed stones forming navigational markers throughout the forest. The morning bell rang from the Glass Pavilion, signaling Paula had begun her session, and Eline departed along a stone-marked path.

#### Chapter 14: The Temporal Breach - Scene 3

The high-pitched ringing sliced through the air like a blade, cutting through the birdsong and the relentless hum of the Midnight Sun. Paula, the embodiment of the retreat's moral compass, stood in the center of the meadow, her hand poised above the brass bell as if conducting an orchestra of unease.

The final chime faded, replaced by the churning roar of the river in the distance—a sound that had become Kyle's anchor in the sea of white linen and relentless light. He watched from the periphery, his back to the Longhouse, his eyes never straying from the figure in the meadow.

Paula began her morning "Alignment," her voice carrying across the open field with rehearsed cadence. But something was off. The blonde wig sat askew on her head, revealing a stark line of dark, sweat-matted hair at the temple—a visual glitch in the otherwise perfect facade.

The group, deep in Stage 3: Dog Brain, gazed at her with vacant, unblinking eyes, their minds unable to process the contradiction.

As Paula raised her arms in a gesture of unity, Kyle noticed the heavy flannel sleeve that peeked out from under her pristine white linen robe—a wardrobe malfunction that clashed with her carefully curated image. To Kyle, she looked like a corrupted file, a layered image that hadn't finished loading, revealing the disparate elements that were meant to remain hidden.

The sun, a high, clinical white, erased the horizon, turning the sky into an endless expanse of nothingness. The air was stagnant, heavy with the concentrated scent of lilies and the sharp tang of ozone—a fragrant reminder of Aya's presence, no matter the persona.

Paula's voice "clipped" as she attempted to deliver the Imperial Imperative. She began a sentence in her usual maternal high-register, but it morphed into Dawid's masculine rasp by the end. The incongruity hung in the air, an auditory distortion that left a six-second pause—a system latency—as Paula stared at the sun, her pupils contracting to pin-points.

Eline, who sat nearby with her notepad, noticed the change. She had been obsessively recording the session, her hand moving in rhythm with Paula's speech, but now she hesitated, her pencil hovering above the paper. The meticulous notes were punctuated with the space-before-comma glitch that had become a forensic anchor in her search for truth.

Paula had stopped using "One" in her speeches, the impersonal pronoun that distanced her from the group. Instead, she had started using the "будто" filter that Kyle associated with Aya—a linguistic bleed that signified the personas were no longer distinct, no longer separate.

Despite the visible fractures in Paula's facade, the group's compliance held. Their will to see the truth had been eroded by days of relentless exposure to the Midnight Sun, to the constant scrutiny of the retreat's philosophy. Bobi, ever the follower, offered Paula a sacred smile, his mind refusing to acknowledge the black hair or the flannel, choosing instead to embrace the lie that had been fed to them since their arrival.

The horror was in the enforced reality—the group was helping the imposter maintain the lie because the truth was too loud, too disruptive for their tired brains to process.

Kyle felt an overwhelming sense of dread as he observed the scene unfolding before him. The illusion was crumbling, revealing the machinery behind the facade. Yet, the group remained trapped in the cycle of compliance and denial, their identities smeared into a collective of broken minds and shattered psyches.

He knew that he alone could see the fractures—the subtle inconsistencies that betrayed the imposter's deception. But as he stood in the open meadow, under the relentless gaze of the sun, he realized that the truth was a double-edged sword. It was a weapon that could liberate them all, but it was also a beacon that would draw the wrath of the imposter.

As Paula resumed her speech, her voice steadier now, Kyle stepped back into the shadows of the Longhouse, his mind racing with the implications of what he had witnessed. The time for observation was over; it was time to act.

He turned and walked away from the meadow, from the group that had become prisoners of their own quest for transparency. He knew that the path forward would be fraught with danger, that the imposter would not let him disrupt the narrative that she had so carefully constructed.

But as the sound of Paula's voice faded into the background, replaced by the comforting roar of the river, Kyle felt a surge of determination. The imposter had made a mistake—a series of mistakes—and he was going to exploit them to the fullest.

The game was afoot, and he was ready to play.

####

* * *

In the stark, unyielding light of the Bleach Gap, Kyle stood resolute before the Western Cottage, the white-washed wood pulsating in the midday sun. The glare was intense, the light so concentrated that it seemed to emanate from within the walls, casting an otherworldly glow on the surrounding area. Here, in this temporal no-man's-land, Kyle knew he would confront the architect of deception, the weaver of lies.

The sun reached its zenith, marking the transition between personas. It was 12:00—the hour of Aya, the time when the Vessel should have emerged in her carefully crafted guise of vulnerability. But today, the script would change. Today, Kyle would introduce a new variable into the equation.

As the Imposter emerged from the cottage, Kyle stepped into her path, his shadow a stark line against the white gravel. He held the Temporal Grid—a series of interconnected lines and numbers scribbled on a piece of recycled commune paper—like a shield. With a voice as steady as the relentless sun above, he read aloud the sacred times: "06:00. 12:00. 22:00." He recited the schedule as if it were a mantra, a de-programming code designed to disrupt the carefully orchestrated performance.

Aya—trapped mid-transition, her wig discarded but Paula's reading glasses still perched on her nose, Dawid's heavy boots weighing her down—halted. The cacophony of personas she embodied was momentarily silenced by the sound of her own name, spoken with such certainty that it cut through the layers of pretense like a blade.

The figure before Kyle seemed anatomically impossible, a grotesque amalgamation of the personas she had so meticulously crafted. Her breathing escalated into a rhythmic pattern, mirroring Mia's old anxiety tic—a 4/4 time that thrummed in the air like a living pulse. Hyperventilation caused her chest to heave, the linen fabric straining against the sudden, erratic movements.

Kyle watched, a detached part of his mind cataloging the signs of unraveling. The Imposter was no longer merely Aya. She was the echo of Paula's nurturing cadence and the shadow of Dawid's menacing rasp. She was all of them and none of them, her true self buried beneath the weight of her own deception.

In a panic, the Imposter reached for the Theatrical Scent Atomizer—a tool of her trade, now a weapon turned against herself. She depressed the pump with frantic urgency, saturating the air with the artificial scent of lilies. The fragrance, once subtle and elusive, now hung heavy and cloying, a toxic cloud that masked the raw, animalistic scent of fear emanating from her pores.

The familiar floral notes were tainted, transformed into something harsh and chemical. It was the smell of a mask slipping, the scent of a truth too terrible to confront. The lilies, once a symbol of purity and innocence, now signified the opposite—a lie so pervasive that it had become a poison, infecting the very air they breathed.

Aya's scream never materialized as a sound. Instead, it manifested as a silent, static presence that filled the space between them. Her eyes, wide and wild, flickered with the recognition of her own entrapment. She was a prisoner within the personas she had created—a marionette whose strings were tangled inextricably with her own identity.

Backing away into the relative safety of her cottage, the Imposter moved with an awkward, jerky gait, each step a testament to the collapse of her meticulously constructed reality. The morning bell rang out, its tone discordant and jarring—a final, broken signal that echoed the disintegration of order within the retreat.

Kyle stood alone in the glaring sunlight, the echo of the bell fading into the oppressive silence. The confrontation had not been violent, nor had it been loud. But the impact of the encounter resonated through the very foundations of the Hårga Retreat Center, a seismic shift that heralded the beginning of the end.

As the sun continued its relentless arc across the sky, Kyle turned away from the Western Cottages, his mind already working through the next steps of his plan. The Imposter had been destabilized, her once impervious facade now riddled with cracks and fissures. It was only a matter of time before the truth would burst forth, unstoppable and raw.

The Midnight Sun, once an ally to the Imposter, now served as a relentless interrogator, its unyielding light exposing the lies that had flourished in its glow. Kyle knew that the coming days would test the limits of their collective endurance, pushing them all to the brink of madness. But he also knew that he was closer than ever to unraveling the twisted philosophy that had taken root at the heart of the retreat.

With each step he took away from the Western Cottages, Kyle felt the weight of the Imposter's gaze upon him. She was watching, waiting, her next move obscured by the blinding light of the Bleach Gap. But he was ready. He had seen the fractures, and he would exploit them, using the Imposter's own strategies against her.

As the sun dipped lower in the sky, casting long shadows across the commune, Kyle felt a surge of resolve. The time for observation had passed. The time for action was now. The game was no longer afoot; it was in full play, and he was determined to see it through to the very end.

### Chapter 16: The Social Deletion (Day 12)

#### Chapter 16: The Social Deletion

##### Scene 1: The Alignment of the Blind

The Glass Pavilion at six in the morning was an incubator of pure white agony. Sunlight struck the eastern panes at thirty degrees, transforming each panel into a flat plane of fire that erased depth, shadow, and mercy. The air inside had already thickened to greenhouse density, sweet with the smell of heated pine and the faint chemical undertow of lilies that never quite dispersed from these walls.

Paula stood at the center.

She was shivering.

The contradiction registered in Kyle's peripheral vision as he settled against the far wall, arms crossed, journal pressed flat beneath one elbow. Sweat beaded on every forehead in the room. Bobi's linen clung to his chest in dark patches. Eline's braid had wilted against her neck. The pavilion was a kiln. And Paula shivered like a woman standing in a draft that existed only inside her own skeleton.

"Good morning." The voice cracked on the second word. Not cracked—split. The opening syllable arrived in Paula's warm, measured soprano, the kind of pitch designed to make grown adults feel held. The *morning* dropped two registers into something guttural and compressed, a frequency that belonged to a flannel shirt and a beanie and a voice modulator left running in an empty cottage.

Bobi's hands stopped turning his wooden figure.

Paula raised her arms for the opening gesture—the Expansion, she called it, palms rotating outward to greet the light. Her left sleeve fell back. Flannel cuff. Red and black check fabric visible for three full seconds before she yanked the linen down, fingers trembling so violently the fabric bunched at her wrist and stayed bunched.

The wig sat two centimeters too far forward on her skull. Dark roots showed above both ears in crescents that caught the white fire from the glass and turned the exposed hair into wire. Her reading glasses—the ones that restructured her facial geometry into the approachable architecture of a school counselor—sat crooked, one arm higher than the other, so her left eye appeared magnified and her right remained bare and narrow and black.

"We begin with breath. You must—" The Imperial Imperative. The verbal signature. But the must dissolved into a wet cough that bent her at the waist. When she straightened, her right hand pressed against her sternum as though holding separate pieces of herself together from the inside. "You must breathe. With purpose. One does not—"

The room waited.

"One does not permit the morning to—"

Silence. The sentence had no destination. Paula's mouth remained open, jaw working, producing small clicks where words should have been. The sound was organic and horrible, like a speaker shorting out behind a mask of skin.

Kyle counted the participants. Eleven bodies arranged in the standard crescent. Bobi on the left, wooden figure gripped so tightly the grain would leave an imprint. Klaudia near the door, boots planted, spiral notebook visible in her cargo pocket. Julia to Klaudia's right, white linen knotted at the waist with the geometric precision of a woman who refused to look institutional even while institutionalized. And Eline—

Eline sat cross-legged at the crescent's apex. No notepad. Her hands rested on her knees, palms up, fingers slightly curled. Her eyes were open but unfocused, pupils dilated to the edges of the iris despite the blinding pavilion light. She had removed her slate-grey underlayer sometime in the night. Pure white linen now. Compliant. Absorbed.

Stage 3.

The Dog Brain had completed its work on Eline's syntax months before Kyle imagined it could. Her clinical vocabulary, her diagnostic distance, her compulsive need to categorize—all of it had been metabolized by sleep deprivation and the Midnight Sun's relentless flattening of interior space. What remained was a woman who observed without interpreting. Recorded without analyzing. A lens with no one behind it.

Paula tried again. She extended both arms and rotated her palms. The gesture was supposed to be symmetrical. Her left hand opened three-quarters of a second after her right. The lag was visible. Mechanical. The mimicry that had once passed through the group like clean current now stuttered and caught, a frequency nobody could tune to.

"Breathe with—" Paula's voice clipped to Dawid's register on *with*. She swallowed hard and corrected: "—with the Vessel's purpose."

Eline stood.

The movement was unhurried. Fluid in the way water is fluid—without decision, without resistance. She unfolded from the floor and rose to her full height, and she did not look at Paula.

She looked at the sun.

The light poured through the eastern glass and struck Eline's face without flinching, and she received it without blinking, her dilated pupils swallowing the glare as though her eyes had been rebuilt to process illumination at intensities the human optic nerve was never designed to sustain. The white linen caught the light and threw it back, and for a moment Eline was indistinguishable from the pavilion walls. A surface among surfaces. Pure reflectivity.

"One does not resonate with a fractured vessel."

Eline's voice carried no inflection. No warmth. No clinical precision. It was the Imperial Imperative stripped of its origin, transplanted from Paula's vocabulary into a mouth that used it with the mechanical conviction of a law being read into public record.

"One must mute the static to hear the light."

Paula's arms dropped.

The crescent moved.

Not individually—collectively, as a single organism receiving a signal below the threshold of conscious hearing. Bobi turned first, his chair scraping against the pine floor, his back squaring itself toward the center of the pavilion with the deliberateness of a door closing. Julia followed, her knotted linen shifting as her spine aligned away from Paula. Klaudia. The long-term guests. The facilitators who had spent six days validating every word from that center point. Each body rotated on its axis, and each rotation was identical in speed and arc, as though choreographed in a rehearsal no one remembered attending.

Eleven backs. Eleven walls of white linen. Eleven spines forming a perimeter around an absence.

The hum began in Bobi's chest. Low. Tonal. A single sustained note that vibrated at the frequency of the river—the same river that had swallowed their devices and their autonomy and their sleep and now provided the sonic template for their collective erasure of the woman at the room's center. Klaudia matched the note. Then Julia. Then the others, one by one, until the pavilion filled with a drone so uniform it ceased to sound human and became architectural. The glass walls amplified it. The pine floor conducted it upward through the soles of bare feet and boots alike. The hum was the room. The room was the hum.

Paula—Aya—the Imposter—stood in the white void they had constructed around her.

"Wait." Paula's register. Maternal. Pleading. "You must listen to me. One does not simply—"

The hum absorbed her voice. Her words entered the frequency and were cancelled, wave meeting antiwave, leaving only the drone.

She stripped the shawl from her shoulders. Beneath it, white linen creased and sweat-stained. She tore the reading glasses from her face and threw them. They hit the glass wall and bounced without breaking, spinning across the floor until they rested at Bobi's heel. He did not move.

"I am not—" She reached for Aya's register. Softer. Trembling. The будто filter surfacing like a reflex. "Is like you no understand, I only—"

The hum did not waver.

She grabbed the wig with both hands and pulled. It came away unevenly, snagging on pins, dragging dark hair across her face in streaks that clung to the sweat on her forehead. Underneath, the skull was matted and damp, the dark hair pressed flat in the shape of the wig cap she had worn for eleven days. She held the blonde hairpiece in her fist like a dead animal.

"Listen." Dawid's command. The aggressive imperative, stripped of modulator, stripped of flannel, stripped of the constructed masculinity that had made retreat guests flinch. Without the technology, the word came out thin. Desperate. A child's impression of authority.

"LISTEN."

The group hummed.

Aya dropped the wig. Her hands went to the linen at her collar and pulled, fabric tearing along the shoulder seam, revealing the chest binding underneath—beige compression fabric darkened with sweat, flattening the body beneath into an androgynous plane. She clawed at the binding, trying to remove it, trying to shed the last persona, trying to reach whatever original surface existed beneath the layers she had built over months of preparation and eleven days of performance.

The glass walls reflected her from every angle. Multiplied her. Twelve fractured copies thrashing in white fire while eleven backs remained stationary, humming, facing outward, seeing nothing because there was nothing left to see.

She screamed.

Not Paula's measured authority. Not Aya's trembling vulnerability. Not Dawid's manufactured menace. A sound without persona, without filter, without the architecture of deception—raw vocal cord vibration torn from a throat that had spent eleven days speaking in voices that did not belong to it. The scream hit the glass and bounced back and hit the glass again, trapped in the pavilion's acoustics, ricocheting between transparent walls that offered no absorption.

The hum continued.

The sun continued.

The eleven white backs did not turn. They had achieved the thing the retreat had always promised. Radical transparency. They saw through her. Through the linen, through the binding, through the wig and the glasses and the modulator and the scent and the scripts and the imperial imperatives and the будто filter and the space before every comma. They saw through all of it, and on the other side they found exactly what the philosophy had always insisted they would find when the last wall came down.

Nothing.

The hum was one. The light was one. The glass was one. The vessel was empty. The noise was gone. They were the light.

Aya sank to her knees on the pine floor, the torn linen pooling around her, the wig at arm's length, the glasses reflecting the sun from where they lay against the wall. Her scream thinned to a wheeze, then to silence, then to the sound of breathing that matched no persona because there was no persona left to match.

Kyle watched from the wall. He did not hum. He did not turn his back. He stood with his arms crossed and his journal pressed against his ribs and his moissanite stones dead in his pocket, throwing no light in a room that was already drowning in it. His face held no triumph.

The group had done what he could not. They had deleted her. Not with evidence or confrontation or forensic grids sketched in mechanical pencil. With absence. With the same collective machinery she had built and aimed at him, now reversed, now pointed inward, now consuming its architect with the efficiency of a system performing exactly as designed.

The pavilion hummed.

The sun climbed.

The woman on the floor breathed.

##### 

####

* * *

The North Gorge did not offer darkness, only a different frequency of blinding white. At the base of the falls, the mist functioned like a diffusion filter, scattering the relentless Midnight Sun into a suffocating, omnidirectional glow. There were no shadows here to hide the anatomy of the fall.

Kyle navigated the wet limestone, his movement mechanical. He had successfully suppressed the Dog Brain that had plagued him in the birch forest. He was no longer a participant in a wellness retreat; he was a forensic auditor at a crash site.

He approached the object on the rocks.

It was not Mia. It was a biological outcome.

Kyle raised the phone Klaudia had slipped into his pocket during the chaos of the morning transition. He did not look at the face of the body—froze that part of his cognition—and focused entirely on the geometry of the limbs. The left leg was bent at an angle that human joints did not permit. The femur had snapped, tenting the sodden white linen of her trousers. The water from the falls washed over her continuously, a relentless scrubbing motion that diluted the blood leaking from her skull into a pale, translucent pink that disappeared instantly into the frothing current.

He framed the shot. Click.

He moved two degrees to the right. The "Ascension" Paula had preached about was physically verifyable here. It was gravity. It was impact velocity. It was the total structural failure of a human vessel.

Kyle documented the lack of defensive wounds on the hands. She hadn't fought. She had been "emptied" before she fell. He took the photo. He treated the scene as a data set, a series of inputs and outputs that needed to be balanced to zero.

He stepped closer, his boots sliding on the algae-slicked stone. The roar of the water was a wall of white noise, cancelling out the need for silence.

Then, the smell hit him.

It should have smelled of glacial melt, wet stone, and pine. Instead, cutting through the spray with impossible clarity, was the scent of lilies.

It was the chemical cloying sweetness of the theatrical atomizer. The scent of the "Moralist." It clung to the body, trapped in the fabric of the linen even after days in the water, or perhaps reapplied. It was a preservative scent. Formaldehyde and floral extract. The olfactory signature of the imposter.

Kyle crouched. Near the crown of the head, half-buried in the grey silt, something white glinted—harder and brighter than the limestone.

He reached into the freezing water and pulled it free. A shard of white porcelain. The curvature was distinct. It was a piece of the bowl Aya had gifted Mia during the river ritual. *To hold your resonance,* she had said.

The shard had a jagged edge, sharp enough to cut. Kyle turned it over. The break was clean. It was the physical artifact of the betrayal. The "vessel" hadn't just cracked; it had been smashed against the rocks along with the woman who held it.

He placed the shard on the wet stone next to Mia’s hand. He framed the composition: the dead hand, the broken porcelain, and the unnatural angle of the arm.

Click.

Kyle stepped back. The sun beat down on the back of his neck, a physical weight. He unlocked the phone. The signal was weak at the bottom of the gorge, one bar flickering in and out of existence. He opened the encrypted messaging app he shared with Klaudia and Julia.

He selected the photo. The image was grainy, high-contrast, terrifyingly mundane.

He did not type a eulogy. He did not type a scream. He needed to break the hypnotic syntax that held the others in the "Dread Gap." He needed to speak the killer's language to prove the killer's presence.

He typed two words and a punctuation mark, deliberately overriding the autocorrect that tried to fix the spacing.

*Full Transparency ,*

He hit send.

The progress bar crawled. The white circle spun. The mist dampened the screen.

*Sent.*

---

Up in the meadow, inside the frantic, heat-stroke silence of the Dread Gap, Julia’s pocket vibrated.

She stood near the trestle tables, her eyes glazed, her mind pulsing with the residue of the humming. Klaudia stood three feet away, staring at the tree line, counting pine needles to keep from dissolving.

Julia pulled the phone from her waistband. The screen was the only thing in the world with a color that wasn't gold or white.

She looked at the image.

The brain tries to reject data that destroys its reality. Julia’s mind tried to see a rock, a log, a pile of laundry. But the hand was undeniable. The angle of the leg was undeniable.

And then the text.

*Full Transparency ,*

The glitch. The space before the comma. The fingerprint of the text that had been on the schedules, on the "suicide" note, on the daily affirmations.

Klaudia moved to her side, blocking the sun with her body. She looked at the screen.

The "Ascension" evaporated. The mythology of the Outer Circle shattered into wet bone and porcelain. Mia had not transcended. She had been discarded.

Julia looked up. The "hostile hygge" of the meadow, the flowers, the white linen—it all sheared away. She wasn't looking at a wellness retreat anymore. She was looking at a crime scene that had been scrubbed with light.

Klaudia’s hand gripped Julia’s wrist. Hard. A physical anchor.

"She didn't leave," Klaudia whispered, her voice cracking the dry air. "She was broken."

The horror settled in, cold and absolute. It wasn't the fear of being exposed anymore. It was the biological terror of being next.

### Chapter 17: The Porcelain Sacrifice

The group moved as one, a silent, synchronized file of white linen and blank faces. The path to the North Gorge was a narrow strip of bleached stone, the air above it shimmering with heat. The sun was a blinding orb, its light so intense it flattened the landscape into a stark tableau of black and white. No shadows, no depth, just the harsh contrast of light and dark.

Their feet crunched in unison, a mechanical march that echoed off the limestone. They were no longer individuals but a collective entity, a single organism moving with one purpose. The Midnight Sun had stripped them of their identities, reducing them to **Stage 3: Dog Brain** compliance. They did not look at the figure they herded towards the gorge. They did not need to. Their collective gaze was a physical force, a **White Noise** that pushed Aya forward, one stumbling step at a time.

Aya was a grotesque amalgamation of her former personas. She wore Dawid's heavy boots, the white linen dress, and clutched Paula's blonde wig like a lifeless pet. Her face was a **Linguistic Smear**, a blur of features that held echoes of all three identities but settled on none. She tried to speak, to command, to plead, but her voice was a broken thing. A wet, static-filled sound that held no language, no power. The group's humming, a low, relentless 40Hz drone, swallowed her attempts at communication. They were beyond words now, beyond reason. They were the **Dog Brain**, and they were moving as one.

The path widened as they reached the gorge. The roar of the falls was a solid wall of sound, a white noise that drowned out thought and sensation. The mist from the water was a blinding curtain, a visual static that erased the world beyond the gorge. Kyle watched from the perimeter, his eyes narrowed against the brutal light. He saw the group form a semi-circle, their backs to the forest, their faces to the sun. They were a **Wall of Gaze**, a silent, unyielding force that left Aya only one direction to move: backward.

Eline stood at the centre of the semi-circle, her eyes bloodshot and waxy. She looked at Aya with a clinical detachment, her face a mask of calm. When she spoke, her voice was a whisper, a final diagnosis delivered to a patient who was already gone.

"The vessel is full of noise," she said, her voice barely audible over the roar of the falls. "One must empty it to save the resonance."

Aya looked at the group, her eyes wide and wild. She saw the blank faces, the unblinking stares, the silent, synchronized breathing. She saw the colony she had created, the **Dog Brain** she had cultivated and nurtured. And she saw that they were no longer her audience. They were her executioners.

She did not fight. She did not scream or plead or rage against the machine she had built. She simply stepped backward, her boots slipping on the peroxide-bleached limestone. The mist from the falls enveloped her, erasing her from view. The group watched, their humming unbroken, their gazes unwavering. They watched as the figure that had controlled them, that had shaped them and broken them, disappeared into the white void.

The humming stopped. The group blinked, their eyes adjusting to the sudden absence of their target. They looked at each other, their faces blank, their minds empty. Then, as one, they turned and began the march back to the meadow. Their work was done. The vessel had been emptied. The resonance had been saved.

Kyle watched them go, his heart pounding in his chest. He looked at the gorge, at the blinding mist and the roaring falls. He looked at the spot where Aya had stood, where she had stepped backward into the void. And he knew, with a cold and terrible certainty, that the horror was not over. It was just beginning.

* * *

Aya did not fall; she was subtracted from the ledge. Her body, a pale smudge against the stark limestone, lost all semblance of grace in the harsh, flat light. The air did not whistle as she plummeted—it screamed, forcing its way into the folds of her linen dress, turning it into a shroud that billowed uselessly, unable to bear the weight of her transgressions. She tumbled down the cliff face, a grotesque parody of the dancer she once was, her limbs flailing in a macabre ballet.

Halfway down, her body met the limestone outcrop with a sound that was not a thud but a high, dry snap. The winter branch breaking underfoot. Her femur did not merely break; it splintered like dry cedar, the stark white marrow exposed to the relentless sun. The sight was obscene, the brightness of the bone against the rock a testament to the brutal force of her impact. Her body crumpled, the unnatural angle of her leg a silent scream of agony.

The resulting spray of blood was a neon graffiti against the sterile white cliff. A rendering error in the pristine landscape. The crimson was too bright, too saturated, like spilled paint on an operating theater floor. It was a violent, visceral reminder of the life that had been so brutally extinguished. The blood dripped down the limestone, a stark contrast to the pale rock, a final, defiant shout of colour in a world bleached of all hue.

She hit the base of the falls with a heavy, rhythmic sound. The sound of wet laundry striking stone. The impact was final, absolute. Her body lay in a chaotic pile, limbs bent at impossible angles, like a marionette discarded by a careless puppeteer. The white linen of her dress was a stark contrast to the dark, wet stone, the fabric clinging to her broken form like a shroud.

The glacial river, white with silt, immediately began its scrubbing. It pulled the red from the stone and the linen, swallowing it into its cold, opaque throat. The water churned, a relentless, unfeeling force that erased all trace of the violence that had occurred. The scene was bleached back to its original, holy silence, the only sound the relentless roar of the falls. The river did not care about the life it had claimed, the blood it had washed away. It was indifferent, a force of nature that existed only to erase, to cleanse, to purify.

The group watched from above, their faces blank, their eyes unseeing. They had done their duty, had emptied the vessel, had saved the resonance. They had no more use for the broken figure at the base of the falls, the pathetic remains of the woman who had once controlled them. They turned away, their minds already moving on to the next task, the next ritual, the next sacrifice. They were the Dog Brain, and they existed only to serve the resonance, to maintain the purity of the vessel. They had no room for sentiment, for regret, for guilt. They had done what was necessary, and they would do it again, and again, until the vessel was pure, until the resonance was saved.

Kyle watched them go, his heart pounding in his chest. He looked at the gorge, at the blinding mist and the roaring falls. He looked at the spot where Aya had stood, where she had stepped backward into the void. And he knew, with a cold and terrible certainty, that the horror was not over. It was just beginning. The vessel was empty, the resonance was saved, but the cost had been high. The blood of the innocent had been spilled, the lives of the faithful had been claimed. And for what? For a lie, a deception, a twisted, perverted version of the truth.

He turned away from the gorge, his mind racing. He had to find a way to stop this, to end the madness, to save the others from the same fate that had befallen Aya. He had to find a way to expose the truth, to reveal the lie, to shatter the illusion that held them all captive. He had to find a way to save them, to save himself, to save them all from the horror that was the Hårga Retreat Centre. He had to find a way to bring the light, to expose the darkness, to shatter the vessel and save the resonance. He had to find a way to end the nightmare, to bring the dawn, to save them all from the endless, blinding light of the Midnight Sun.

* * *

The group turned as one. No backward glance. No hesitation. The faces were porcelain masks, beatific and stationary, painted with the same serene satisfaction Kyle had seen during the craft sessions and morning alignments. To them, the Noise had been successfully filtered. The vessel had been emptied. The resonance was pure.

They moved in perfect synchronization, white linen swaying with their rhythmic steps. Bobi led the procession, his hands no longer twitching, his stutter consumed by the 40Hz hum that still vibrated in his chest. Eline followed, her clinical notepad discarded somewhere in the meadow, her face blank as freshly bleached paper. Julia and Klaudia walked side by side, but their coordinated glances were gone, replaced by identical vacant stares. They were no longer investigators. They were no longer anything but vessels.

The sun bore down on them as they marched, casting no shadows. Their footsteps on the limestone created a percussive rhythm—one-two, one-two—metronomic and absolute. They did not speak. They did not need to. The work was done.

Kyle remained.

#### 

He waited until the last white figure disappeared into the tree line before crawling to the edge. His hands found the sharp limestone, the same rock that had shattered Aya's femur and sprayed crimson across its bleached surface. But the glacier-fed river had already scrubbed it clean. The stone was white again. Pure.

Kyle forced himself to look down.

He didn't see a body.

The mist from the waterfall churned thirty feet below, a white curtain that obscured the base of the falls. The river roared, its silt-heavy current opaque and relentless. But snagged on a jagged outcrop, fluttering in the updraft, was a single white shroud.

Paula's wig.

It clung to the rock like a patch of foam, the synthetic blonde strands matted and darkened by spray. The wig had been her crown, her final disguise, the last remnant of the Moralist persona that had orchestrated everything. Now it hung limp and abandoned, a flag of surrender in the mist.

Kyle's eyes tracked the churning water below, searching for the broken form, the twisted limbs, the white linen dress. But the river gave nothing back. The Operator had vanished into the mist, swallowed by the glacial current, erased by the same relentless force that had cleansed Mia's blood from the rocks.

#### 

The scent hit him before he could retreat.

Lilies. Thick and cloying, rising from the gorge like funeral incense. The theatrical atomizer's signature—formaldehyde and floral sweetness—hung in the air, refusing to dissipate. It was thicker than ever, as if Aya's final breath had released the entire reservoir of her deception into the atmosphere.

Kyle pressed his sleeve to his nose, but the scent penetrated the fabric, clinging to his skin, his hair, his lungs. It was synthetic, artificial, a chemical ghost that would not be bleached away by the sun or scrubbed clean by the river. The Imposter was gone, but her perfume remained, a cloying cloud that marked the air as contaminated.

Kyle's stomach turned. He stumbled backward from the edge, his hand slipping on the limestone.

His palm landed on something solid.

#### 

A single boot.

Dawid's boot. The flannel-clad masculine persona's signature footwear, left at the ledge like a discarded costume piece. It was empty. No foot. No leg. Just the hollow shell of leather and rubber, still laced, still tied.

Kyle lifted it, turning it over in his hands. The sole was scuffed from the limestone paths, the interior stained with the same lily scent. It was real. Physical. A forensic anchor in a world that had lost all definition.

But the Dread Gap opened.

In the blinding light, Kyle could not be one hundred percent certain he had seen her hit the water. The mist had obscured the base of the falls. The sun had flattened the depth, making the gorge appear like a painted backdrop rather than a three-hundred-foot drop. He had seen the body fall. He had heard the sound. But the light—the relentless, unblinking Midnight Sun—had rendered the final moment invisible.

He only knew the Vessel was no longer on the cliff.

Kyle stood at the edge, gripping the empty boot, staring into the white mist where the river consumed everything. The lily scent wrapped around him like a shroud. The wig fluttered on the rocks below. And somewhere in the Longhouse, the group sat in their circle, humming their sacred note, waiting for the next ritual, the next sacrifice, the next vessel to empty.

The horror was not the fall.

The horror was that he could not be certain it had ended.

### Chapter 18: The Receding Horizon (Rotterdam)

#### Chapter 18: The Desaturated World - Scene 1

The rain fell on Rotterdam, but it was the wrong kind of grey.

Kyle sat in the high-rise apartment from Chapter 1, in the same chair where he had forwarded the retreat confirmation email seven weeks ago. The city pressed against the windows—leaden, muffled, dim. The sky hung like wet concrete, offering no relief from the weight of its flatness.

It was too grey.

After the Midnight Sun, after the unblinking gold that had flattened depth and bleached meaning from the world, Rotterdam looked like a fading photocopy. The buildings across the canal lacked definition. The trees below were smudges of darker grey against lighter grey. The world had lost its contrast.

Kyle's eyes ached.

Chromatic Hunger, Eline had called it. Their retinas searched constantly for the glare that had once tortured them, the surgical brightness that had stripped away privacy and shadow and sleep. Now, sitting in the dim afternoon light of a Dutch autumn, Kyle felt a terrible absence. The grey was a bruise. The shadows were wounds.

Across the room, Eline sat on the floor beside the bookshelf, her back against the wall. She wore slate-grey clothing again—her clinical armour, reclaimed from the wardrobe after a week of white linen. But her hands remained empty. No notepad. No pen.

Julia sat on the sofa, her phone face-down on the cushion beside her. She had not touched it since the taxi from Schiphol.

They did not speak.

The sentences would not come. Complex thoughts felt like corrupted files, too heavy to load. Kyle's mind offered only fragments: *The rain is wet. The sky is grey. The cup is on the table.* Subject-verb-object. Dog Brain syntax. The Stage 3 cognitive collapse had followed them home, a parasite that had burrowed into the language centres of their brains and refused to leave.

Kyle reached for the lamp beside his chair. His hand stopped.

Shadows pooled beneath the coffee table, dark and organic, spreading like stains across the hardwood floor. Kyle stared at them. His chest tightened. The shadows looked wrong. Impure. He withdrew his hand and left the lamp unlit.

Eline did the same. She glanced at the overhead light switch, her fingers twitching, then folded her hands in her lap and returned her gaze to the floor.

They sat in the gathering dusk, waiting for nothing.

#### 

Julia stood and crossed to the hallway. She opened the drawer of the console table where she kept her passport, her house keys, the receipts from the retreat booking that Kyle had insisted they file for insurance purposes.

The drawer slid open.

Lilies.

The scent rose from the wood like a cloying cloud—thick, synthetic, laced with formaldehyde. It was the Atomizer. Aya's theatrical perfume, the one she had sprayed in desperate bursts during the Bleach Gap, the one that had clung to Mia's body at the base of the falls.

Julia stepped back.

Her heart rate spiked, a rhythmic 4/4 thump that matched the morning circle's humming. She looked into the drawer. Her passport sat undisturbed. The receipts were stacked in a neat pile. There was no bottle. No vial. No atomizer.

But the scent remained, hanging in the air like funeral incense.

Julia closed the drawer. The scent did not dissipate. It followed her back to the sofa, settling into the fabric of her clothing, the strands of her hair. She sat down and picked up her phone, then set it back down without unlocking it.

Kyle watched her from across the room. He saw her nostrils flare, saw the tension in her jaw. He smelled it too. The lilies had invaded the apartment, crossing the border from Sweden to the Netherlands, from the living to the dead.

The Olfactory Haunting had begun.

#### 

At exactly 18:00, Kyle stopped mid-breath.

His hand, reaching for the glass of water on the side table, froze. His gaze fixed on a point in the middle distance, unfocused and waiting. Across the room, Eline's fingers halted their repetitive tracing of the spine of a book she had not opened. Julia's hand went still on her phone screen.

The System Stutter.

They waited for the twelve-minute gap. For the scrape of boots on limestone. For the high maternal register to crack and shift into Dawid's masculine rasp. For the blonde wig to be lifted and the flannel shirt to be discarded. For the operator to transition between masks.

But no transition came.

The apartment remained silent. The rain continued its dull patter against the windows. The grey light did not shift.

Sixty seconds passed. Two minutes. Five.

At 18:12, Kyle blinked. His hand completed its journey to the glass. Eline turned a page she did not read. Julia exhaled and set her phone aside.

They were no longer at Hårga, but the schedule had followed them home. Their bodies still obeyed the twelve-minute rhythm, still waited for Paula at 06:00, Aya at 12:00, Dawid at 22:00. The Midnight Sun's cycle had colonized their circadian rhythms, embedding itself in the neural pathways that governed sleep and wakefulness and submission.

They were still prisoners.

#### 

Eline stood and walked to the small laundry alcove off the kitchen. She opened the dryer, pulling out the load of dark clothing she had washed upon her return. She reached into the lint trap, her fingers closing around the usual grey dust.

And something else.

A shard. Bone-white. Sharp.

Porcelain.

Eline lifted it into the dim light. It was a fragment no larger than her thumbnail, clean and impossibly smooth. The edges were surgical. It gleamed faintly, refracting the grey daylight into nothing.

It was the bowl. The one Aya had given Mia during the river ritual. The one that had shattered at the base of North Gorge and pierced Kyle's palm when he found Mia's body.

Eline's heart did not race. Her breath did not catch.

She walked back into the living room and placed the shard on the mantle above the electric fireplace, beside a framed photograph of the group from two years ago—before GlowGlitch, before burnout, before Hårga.

The porcelain sat like a relic. Sacred. Unquestionable.

Kyle and Julia watched her. Neither spoke.

The shard gleamed in the grey light, a seed of white horror that had crossed the border, travelled through luggage and laundry and lint, and planted itself in the heart of their home.

The Imposter was gone.

But the residue remained.

#### Chapter 18: The Receding Horizon — Scene 2: The Linguistic Infection

The monitor cast Kyle's face in cold blue. His home office—the one room in the Rotterdam apartment he had kept locked since returning—smelled of leather and stale coffee and something else. Something floral. Something that had no source.

He placed his hands on the keyboard. The document was open. A blank page in a word processor, formatted to the specifications of the Rotterdam-Rijnmond police district: twelve-point serif, double-spaced, reference number in the header. He had obtained the template from the district's website three days ago. He had not typed a single word since.

The cursor blinked. Black line on white field. Steady. Mechanical.

Kyle began.

*On or about 26 June, at the location known as Hårga Retreat Centre, Dalarna County, Sweden, the individual operating under the aliases—*

He stopped. The words sat on the screen like stones dropped into still water. Each one carried weight he could feel in his wrists, his forearms, the rigid column of his spine. *Operating under the aliases.* Forensic language. Stage 1 language. The kind of language he had used in his leather journal when the moissanite stones still refracted light and the world still parsed into clean categories: evidence, hypothesis, conclusion.

The words were loud.

Not in volume. In mass. They pressed against the inside of his skull like objects too large for the room they occupied. *Individual.* *Operating.* *Aliases.* Each syllable demanded a certainty he no longer possessed. To write *the individual killed Mia Janssen* required Kyle to inhabit a version of himself that could distinguish between what he had witnessed and what the Midnight Sun had shown him. Between what Aya had done and what the light had permitted.

His fingers hovered. The cursor blinked. He deleted the line.

#### 

He started again.

*The events at North Gorge must be understood in the context of the collective experience. The group had been operating under extreme duress—sleep deprivation, sensory overload, and the systematic erosion of individual—*

Kyle read the sentence back. His jaw tightened.

*Must be understood.* Paula's register. The Imperial Imperative. *One must reflect. You must bring it into the light.* The maternal instruction that brooked no dissent, wrapped in the cadence of care.

He was not writing a report. He was writing a script.

The realization landed without shock. It settled into his chest the way the 18:00 System Stutter settled into his limbs—familiar, expected, beyond resistance. His fingers continued moving across the keys as if responding to dictation from a source located somewhere behind his sternum.

*The necessity of what occurred at the gorge cannot be separated from the process of radical transparency. The vessel was fractured. The resonance required—*

Kyle's hands stopped. He stared at the word *vessel.* Aya's word. The word that had spread through the group like a virus, replacing *person* and *self* and *I* with a hollow container waiting to be filled or emptied. He had catalogued its proliferation in his journal. He had watched Bobi adopt it, then Eline, then Mia. He had noted the exact moment Julia first used it without irony.

He had never used it himself.

Until now.

He did not delete it.

#### 

The final paragraph assembled itself beneath his fingers. Kyle watched his hands work with the detached curiosity of a man observing someone else's body perform a familiar task. The keystrokes were precise. Mechanical. The rhythm matched the 40Hz hum the group had sustained at the gorge—steady, unbroken, collective.

His right thumb moved to the space bar. Pressed once. Then again.

The sentence appeared on the screen:

*We are safe now , будто the sun has finally gone.*

Kyle's hands withdrew from the keyboard. They settled in his lap, palms upward, fingers loose. The posture of reception. The posture Paula had taught them on the first morning in the Glass Pavilion.

The space before the comma glowed on the screen. A single gap. A typographical error that had followed him from Aya's schedules to Paula's handouts to Dawid's dossiers to Mia's forged suicide note to his own forensic journal and now here, to this document intended for the Dutch police.

The будто sat beside it. *As if.* Aya's filter. The word she used to hold reality at arm's length, to keep every statement provisional, every truth conditional. *As if* the sun had gone. *As if* they were safe. *As if* the operator had died at the falls rather than dispersing into the linguistic systems of everyone she had touched.

Kyle did not move the cursor. Did not highlight the errors. Did not press delete.

A warmth spread through his chest. Not comfort. Not relief. Something cleaner. Something white. The sensation of surrender to a system that no longer required his consent because it had already received his participation.

Holy Compliance.

The laptop's camera lens stared at him from the top of the screen. A small glass circle rimmed in black. Unblinking. The only eye in the room that did not need to close, did not need to rest, did not need the mercy of darkness.

Kyle looked into it.

He did not blink back.

The screen remained white. The cursor pulsed. The space before the comma held.
