## Chapter 1: The Strained Dinner Party
title_cn: 第一章：紧绷的晚宴

The dinner table was set with a precision that felt archival, less a place for eating and more a display of domestic triumph.
餐桌的摆设精确得仿佛是为了归档，与其说是为了用餐，不如说是为了展示家庭的某种胜利。

Silverware gleamed under the recessed lighting, equidistant from the porcelain plates, the geometry of it all suggesting that chaos had been mathematically eliminated from the room.
银器在嵌入式灯光下闪耀，与瓷盘保持着等距，这种几何美感暗示着混乱已被极其精确地从这个房间里剔除了。

"You're quiet," Eline said. It wasn't a question. Her voice had the quality of a scalpel—clean, sharp, expecting to find something beneath the surface.
“你很安静，”埃琳说。这不是一个问句。她的声音带着手术刀般的质感——干净、锐利，似乎总想在表象之下剖析出什么。

Liam looked up from his wine glass. The merlot was a deep, violently dark red against the white tablecloth. "Just thinking."
利亚姆从酒杯上抬起头。梅洛红酒映衬着洁白的桌布，呈现出一种深沉而暴力的暗红色。“只是在思考。”

"About the trip?"
“关于这次旅行？”

"About the cost," he lied. He was thinking about the email. The one he hadn't deleted. The one that sat in his inbox like a dormant virus.
“关于费用，”他撒了谎。他在想那封邮件。那封他还没有删除的邮件。那封像休眠病毒一样躺在他收件箱里的邮件。

Eline sliced her steak. The knife made a sound against the ceramic that set Liam's teeth on edge. *Skree.* "It's an investment, Liam. Networking. These people... they aren't just friends. They're keys."
埃琳切着她的牛排。刀锋划过陶瓷的声音让利亚姆不由得咬紧了牙关。*滋——* “这是一项投资，利亚姆。人脉建设。这些人……他们不只是朋友。他们是钥匙。”

"Keys to what?"
“通往什么的钥匙？”

"To the next level. To stability." She chewed precisely. "You need this."
“通往下一个阶层的钥匙。通往稳定的钥匙。”她精确地咀嚼着。“你需要这个。”

The unsaid words hung in the air: *Because you are failing.*
未说出口的话悬在空中：*因为你是个失败者。*

He took a drink. The wine tasted metallic, like licking a battery. "Right. The Resort."
他喝了一口酒。酒的味道带着金属味，就像在舔舐电池。“好吧。度假村。”

"It's exclusive," Eline continued, her eyes dissecting his expression. "Hårga. It's not just a retreat. It's a... cleansing."
“那是专属的，”埃琳继续说道，她的目光解剖着他的表情。“霍尔加（Hårga）。这不仅仅是一个度假地。这是一场……净化。”

Liam suppressed a shiver. He didn't want to be cleansed. He wanted to be hidden. But in Eline's world, visibility was currency, and he was currently overdrawn.
利亚姆压抑住一阵寒颤。他不想被净化。他想被隐藏。但在埃琳的世界里，可见度就是货币，而他现在的账户已经透支了。
