            <h1>The Algorithm of Envy [Case File: N.Vermeer_FINAL]</h1>
            <p style="color: var(--color-text-secondary); font-size: 0.9em; margin-top: -0.5em;">AUTHOR: Stieg Larsson
                (Simulated)</p>

            <h2>PART I: THE DEFICIT</h2>
            <p>The Netherlands is a country of engineered landscapes; everything is measured, reclaimed from the sea,
                and managed. But in the social housing block of a forgotten rural town, Noa Vermeer was a variable the
                state could not manage.</p>
            <p>At thirty-two, Noa was a woman constructed of contradictions. Her heritage was a map of colonial
                history—Dutch and Black—but she lived in a fantasy of the 1960s, a sepia-toned delusion where she was a
                classical muse, not a welfare recipient drowning in bureaucracy. The peeling paint of her apartment was
                hidden behind stacks of vinyl records she played to drown out the silence.</p>
            <p>She had a daughter, Melody, aged six. But Melody was an abstraction now, a piece of property being
                contested in a court docket Noa refused to open. The father had a job. The father had stability. Noa had
                HelloTalk.</p>
            <p>It was here, in the invisible architecture of the internet, that she met Kyle.</p>
            <p>Kyle was the apex predator of the digital age. Chinese, thirty-five, radiating the kind of financial
                security that acts as an aphrodisiac to the desperate. He was building an e-commerce empire on the back
                of Artificial Intelligence. He was "Daddy" to the girls in the voice chat—a joke that wasn't really a
                joke. He possessed a physique carved in a gym and a voice that sounded like expensive mahogany.</p>
            <p>Noa didn't just like him. She calculated him. She saw him not as a man, but as an exit strategy.</p>

            <h2>PART II: THE REJECTION ERROR</h2>
            <p>The catastrophe happened on a Tuesday.</p>
            <p>Noa had rehearsed the sentence for days. “Ik vind je leuk.” (I like you). She typed it into the private
                chat, her heart hammering against ribs that felt too thin for her body.</p>
            <p>Kyle’s response was immediate, polite, and lethal. He had consulted Eline—the group's resident
                psychologist, the woman Noa secretly worshipped and despised—on how to defuse the bomb without shrapnel.
                "I like you as well, Noa. As a friend."</p>
            <p>It was a sterile, diplomatic execution. Noa stared at the screen. The humiliation was absolute. It wasn't
                heartbreak; it was a system failure. She had been categorized as "Friend." In Noa’s binary world,
                "Friend" meant "Zero."</p>
            <p>She didn't cry. She screenshotted. She archived the rejection. Then she archived his photos. Then she
                archived his voice.</p>

            <h2>PART III: THE MASQUERADE</h2>
            <p>The group dynamic shifted. Noa became "salty," a term Pia used often. Pia, the blunt German vegan, had no
                patience for delusion. She saw Noa’s attempts to prove Kyle’s interest—spamming the group with
                out-of-context screenshots—as pathetic.</p>
            <p>"He was being polite, Noa," Pia said, her voice cutting through the chat room like a rusted saw. "Move
                on."</p>
            <p>But Noa didn't move on. She evolved.</p>
            <p>The night of the game was the turning point. Truth or Dare. The players: Kyle, Bobi (the clown), Klaudia
                (the Polish beauty), and Noa. Klaudia, with her heavy accent and effortless sexuality, issued the dare:
                Change your name to Klaudia. Wear a black night dress. Show cleavage.</p>
            <p>Noa did it. She stripped off her thrift-store sweater and put on the silk. She adjusted the camera angle.
                For twenty-four hours, she wasn't the struggling mother losing her child; she was Klaudia.</p>
            <p>Kyle: "Wow. That picture turned me from gay to heterosexual."</p>
            <p>Laughter exploded in the voice room. Bobi roared. Klaudia giggled. But Noa sat in her dark living room,
                silent. She heard the timbre of Kyle’s voice drop. She heard the biological intake of breath. He wasn't
                joking. He was aroused. He doesn't want Noa, she realized, a cold rage settling in her stomach. He wants
                the costume. He wants the whore.</p>
            <p>"He is disgusting," she whispered to Eline later. "I heard him." But Eline, usually so perceptive, missed
                the warning signs. She thought Noa was disgusted by Kyle. She didn't realize Noa was taking notes.</p>

            <h2>PART IV: THE DATA HARVEST</h2>
            <p>The obsession metastasized. Noa stopped fighting for custody of Melody. She missed the final hearing. Her
                daughter was gone, taken by the father, but Noa barely noticed. She had a new project.</p>
            <p>She began to study Eline. Eline was the gatekeeper. Eline was the one Kyle respected. Eline was the one
                Kyle asked for advice. Noa asked questions that seemed innocent to the others but were forensic in
                nature. “What perfume is that?” “Do you drive the Audi or the BMW?” “Where is your office located,
                exactly?”</p>
            <p>She went to Amsterdam. She told the group it was a date. It wasn't. She stood outside an office building
                in the rain, watching a blonde woman get into a silver car. She memorized the license plate. She
                memorized the way Eline walked—efficient, confident, unburdened.</p>
            <p>Back in her apartment, Noa watched Kyle’s live streams. But she wasn't listening to his words anymore.
                She was feeding his voice into open-source AI software. She was cloning him. She would kill him, she had
                said in the game. Snap his neck. Bring him back to life. Kill him again. People thought it was
                hyperbole. It was a roadmap.</p>

            <h2>PART V: THE PLOT TWIST</h2>
            <p>Two weeks later. A storm battered the Dutch coast. Kyle was working late in his home office in Rotterdam.
                His AI interface hummed on three monitors. He received a video call request. Caller: Eline_Psych</p>
            <p>He accepted, smiling. He liked Eline. She was the only peer he had in this group of misfits. "Hello,
                Eline," he said.</p>
            <p>The video feed was dark at first, then resolved. It was Eline’s apartment. He recognized the art on the
                walls from previous video chats. Eline sat in the chair, wearing her signature blazer. But something was
                wrong. The lighting was too harsh. Her movements were jagged, glitchy. "Kyle," Eline said. The voice was
                hers. But the cadence was off. It was too rhythmic. Too... classical.</p>
            <p>"I have something to tell you," the woman on the screen said. "Is everything okay?" Kyle leaned in. "Noa
                is dead," the woman said.</p>
            <p>Kyle froze. "What?" "She killed herself. Tonight. She left a note. She said you did it."</p>
            <p>Kyle’s heart hammered. "Me? I... I was just a friend. I rejected her months ago." "The police have your
                chat logs, Kyle. The ones she edited. The ones where you told her to do it."</p>
            <p>Kyle scrambled to his keyboard. "That’s insane. I have the archives. I can prove—" He stopped. His
                archives were gone. His cloud storage: Wiped. His backups: Corrupted.</p>
            <p>"How..." Kyle whispered. "Who are you?"</p>
            <p>The woman on the screen smiled. It wasn't Eline’s smile. It was a rictus of triumph. She leaned forward,
                and the "Deepfake" filter on the camera slipped for a fraction of a second. Underneath the digital mask
                of Eline’s face, Kyle saw the peeling wallpaper of a rural social housing unit. He saw a black night
                dress. He saw eyes that were dead and alive at the same time.</p>
            <p>"I told you," the voice said—shifting now, warping from Eline’s cool alto to Noa’s erratic soprano. "I
                would kill you. And bring you back. And kill you again."</p>

            <h2>PART VI: THE TERMINAL</h2>
            <p>Noa ended the call. She sat in the dark. The "suicide" note lay on the table—a masterpiece of fiction she
                had planted on a server Kyle would inevitably be linked to. She had lost her daughter. She had lost her
                dignity. But she had won the game. She looked at the screen where Kyle’s digital life was currently
                disintegrating, deleted by the malware she had sent him disguised as a music file days ago.</p>
            <p>She picked up her phone and opened HelloTalk. She changed her profile picture to a photo of Eline she had
                taken secretly in Amsterdam. She typed into the group chat, her fingers trembling with excitement.</p>
            <p>User: Eline Message: Guys, something terrible has happened to Kyle. I think we need to talk.</p>
            <p>Outside, the rain washed the village clean, but inside, the rot was just beginning.</p>

            <h2>VII.</h2>
            <p>The silence in my apartment was absolute. It was the expensive, insulated silence I had cultivated for
                years, a barrier against the chaotic frequency of the outside world. Now, it felt like the airlock of a
                sinking ship.</p>
            <p>I stared at the phone screen. The message from "Eline" glowed in the dark room.</p>
            <p>Guys, something terrible has happened to Kyle. I think we need to talk.</p>
            <p>It was a perfect sentence. It was efficient, calm, and laden with appropriate professional concern. It
                was exactly what I would have typed.</p>
            <p>I tried to open the chat to reply. A pop-up appeared: Please log in. I typed my password. The one I used
                for everything, a complex alphanumeric string derived from the street name of my childhood home.
                Incorrect password.</p>
            <p>My stomach dropped, a physical sensation of freefall. I hit "Forgot Password." A reset link has been sent
                to k*****@[suspicious link removed].*</p>
            <p>That wasn't my email address.</p>
            <p>Noa hadn't just kicked in the door; she had changed the locks and deeded the property to herself. I was
                standing outside my own digital existence, watching a squatter rearrange the furniture.</p>
            <p>The group chat exploded. I could only watch the preview notifications stack up on my lock screen,
                powerless to intervene.</p>
            <p>Pia_Ger: WHAT??? Eline what do you mean? Is he hurt? OMG I tried calling him an hour ago and it went
                straight to voicemail!</p>
            <p>Bobi_Indo: Haha very funny Eline. It is April Fools in Netherlands already? Kyle is probably just busy
                counting his money.</p>
            <p>Julia_Pol: Bobi, shut up. Eline, define "terrible."</p>
            <p>And then, the impostor spoke again.</p>
            <p>Eline [Noa]: I don't want to say too much here. The police just contacted me. They found him in his
                office. They think it was... self-inflicted. There’s a lot of data missing. They think he was spiraling.
            </p>
            <p>It was masterful. She was using my cadence, my reluctance to deal in raw emotion. She was painting Kyle
                as unstable—feeding them the narrative she had already planted with the fake suicide note. She was using
                my credibility as a psychologist to validate her revenge fantasy.</p>
            <p>I stood up. My legs felt unsteady, distant. I walked to the window overlooking the rainy Utrecht street.
                I needed to think. I needed to deconstruct this like a case file.</p>
            <p>Noa was a mimic. She had studied me for months—my wardrobe, my car, my speech patterns. She had absorbed
                me. But a mimic, no matter how skilled, always has a tell. A micro-tremor in the voice. A pixel out of
                place in the deepfake.</p>
            <p>I thought back to the video call she had made to Kyle, the one where she wore my face. The warmth. She
                had smiled too warmly when he answered. I don't smile warmly on video calls; I offer a professional
                grimace.</p>
            <p>She was performing empathy, whereas I rationed it.</p>
            <p>I looked back at the phone.</p>
            <p>Pia_Ger: Oh my god. Noa kills herself and now Kyle? What is happening to us? Eline, I need to see you.
                Can I come to Utrecht? Please.</p>
            <p>My breath hitched. Pia. The weak link. The emotional blast radius.</p>
            <p>Eline [Noa]: Not tonight, Pia. I have to deal with the authorities. I’m going to Rotterdam to identify...
                to help with the situation. Stay put. We'll talk tomorrow when things are clearer. Everyone just stay
                calm.</p>
            <p>She was isolating them. She was cutting off physical access, keeping the play on the digital stage where
                she controlled the lighting. If Pia came here, if Pia saw me—the real me, in my sweatpants,
                terrified—the illusion would shatter.</p>
            <p>I knew what Noa would do next. It was the logical progression of the narcissist who has seized control of
                the narrative. She had to preemptively destroy the threat.</p>
            <p>My phone buzzed one more time before I shut it off. A direct message from "Eline" to the group, a
                broadcast.</p>
            <p>Eline [Noa]: Also, one more thing. I’ve been getting strange messages on other platforms. Someone
                pretending to be me. I think it might be related to whatever mental break Kyle was having, maybe he set
                something up before the end. If anyone contacts you claiming to be me from a different number or
                account, block them immediately. It’s crucial for the investigation that we contain this.</p>
            <p>She had checkmated me before I had even moved a pawn.</p>
            <p>I put the phone on the kitchen counter face down. The glass vivarium I had observed them all in had
                shattered, and I was the one standing barefoot in the shards.</p>
            <p>I couldn't fight her online. She was the code now. I had to go analog.</p>
            <p>I went into my bedroom and opened the closet. I bypassed the oatmeal cardigans and the slate-gray
                blazers. I reached to the back, to a garment bag I hadn't opened in years. Inside was a bright red
                leather jacket, something I had bought in a fit of rebellion at nineteen and never worn.</p>
            <p>I put it on. It felt tight, aggressive. It felt like armor. I grabbed my car keys—the physical keys to
                the physical Audi.</p>
            <p>Pia was in Munich. Kyle’s destroyed life was in Rotterdam. Noa’s empty, haunted apartment was in the
                rural north. I didn't know where to start. But I knew I couldn't stay in the silence anymore.</p>
            <p>I walked out the door, leaving the lights on.</p>

            <h2>VIII.</h2>
            <p>My Audi smelled of new leather and expensive detailing spray, a scent I usually found reassuring—the
                smell of control. Tonight, it smelled like a cage.</p>
            <p>I drove south out of Utrecht, the windshield wipers fighting a losing battle against the deluge. The red
                jacket felt alien on my skin, the leather stiff and unyielding. It was a costume, just like Noa’s 1960s
                dresses, just like Pia’s carefully curated humility. We were all just wearing the skin we thought would
                survive the night.</p>
            <p>Why didn't I go to the police? That’s the question a rational person asks.</p>
            <p>Because I knew what would happen. I would walk into a brightly lit station, a hysterical woman in a red
                jacket babbling about stolen avatars and deepfaked suicides in a language learning app. They would offer
                me water in a plastic cup. They would take a statement that would get lost in a digital tray. By the
                time they understood the architecture of the crime, Noa would have burned everything down and rebuilt it
                in my name.</p>
            <p>The law was analog. Noa was digital. I had to fight her in the space between.</p>
            <p>I didn't go to Rotterdam. If Noa was smart—and she was terrifyingly smart—she would have anticipated me
                going to "save" Kyle. She had told the group she was headed there. It was a lure.</p>
            <p>Instead, I turned the car north. Toward the polders. Toward the sinking villages where the government
                parked the people it didn't know what to do with. Toward Noa’s real life.</p>
            <p>The drive took an hour. The highway lights faded, replaced by the immense, oppressive darkness of the
                rural Netherlands. The road narrowed, flanked by black canals that looked like open veins in the earth.
            </p>
            <p>I knew her address. I had found it weeks ago, during that brief period when I sensed something was wrong,
                before my professional arrogance convinced me she was just another needy patient.</p>
            <p>The village was a cluster of postwar brick buildings huddled against the wind. It felt forgotten. The air
                here was heavier, smelling of wet soil and agricultural runoff.</p>
            <p>I found her building. It was a brutalist slab of concrete stained by decades of rain. It was the kind of
                place designed to warehouse humanity, not nurture it. I parked the sleek, silver Audi three streets
                away, tucked behind a derelict tractor. It looked obscenely out of place, a spaceship landed in a peat
                bog.</p>
            <p>I walked to the building, the rain plastering my hair to my skull. I was shivering, but beneath the cold,
                a hard, hot knot of rage was beginning to form in my stomach. She had dared to enter my world. She had
                dared to put on my face.</p>
            <p>The front door of the complex was broken, the lock jammed with something that looked like chewing gum.
                The hallway smelled of boiled cabbage and damp drywall.</p>
            <p>Noa lived on the third floor. Apartment 3B.</p>
            <p>I stood outside her door. The cheap particleboard was peeling at the corners. A sticker of a cartoon
                cat—the kind Melody might have liked—was half-scraped off near the handle.</p>
            <p>I didn't knock. If she was there, knocking gave away the element of surprise. If she wasn't, knocking was
                pointless.</p>
            <p>I tried the handle. Locked.</p>
            <p>I leaned my forehead against the cold wood, listening. The silence from inside was profound. It wasn't
                the quiet of an empty room; it was the quiet of a held breath.</p>
            <p>Then, a sound from behind me.</p>
            <p>A door opened across the hall. An old woman stood there, framed by the yellow light of a television
                playing a game show. She wore a faded floral housecoat and held a lit cigarette like a weapon. Her eyes
                were small, sharp, and clouded with suspicion.</p>
            <p>She looked at my wet hair, my expensive boots, the aggressive red jacket.</p>
            <p>"You the social worker?" she rasped. Her voice sounded like grinding stones.</p>
            <p>I straightened up, accessing the persona I used when dealing with resistant patients. Cool authority.
                "Something like that."</p>
            <p>The woman took a drag of the cigarette, exhaling a plume of blue smoke into the damp hallway. She jerked
                her chin toward Noa's door.</p>
            <p>"You’re too late for the fireworks," she said. "Police were here yesterday. Took the kid. Screaming match
                you could hear in Amsterdam. The boyfriend—the real one, not the imaginary rich one she talks to on the
                computer—he finally grew a spine."</p>
            <p>My heart hammered against my ribs. The real boyfriend. A variable I hadn't accounted for.</p>
            <p>"And Noa?" I asked, keeping my voice steady.</p>
            <p>The old woman laughed, a harsh, coughing sound. "Oh, she put on a show. Played the weeping mother. But
                the second they took that little girl away, the mask dropped."</p>
            <p>She stepped closer, lowering her voice conspiratorially.</p>
            <p>"You want to know what she did? She didn't cry. She didn't pack a bag to go fight for her kid. She went
                back inside and turned that music on. That awful opera screeching. And then I heard her laughing. Not
                happy laughing. Broken glass laughing."</p>
            <p>The woman peered at me closer, her eyes narrowing.</p>
            <p>"Say... you look like the picture."</p>
            <p>I froze. "What picture?"</p>
            <p>"She showed me once. When she was drunk on that cheap sherry she buys. Said, 'Look at my friend, Mevrouw
                Janssen. Look how perfect she is. I'm going to be just like her someday.'" The old woman shook her head.
                "I told her, be careful what you wish for, girl. Sometimes you get the life, and you find out it doesn't
                fit."</p>
            <p>She flicked ash onto the linoleum floor.</p>
            <p>"She ain't in there, honey. She left about four hours ago. Dressed up like it was Halloween. Blonde wig.
                Trench coat. Looked ridiculous, if you ask me. Carrying a suitcase big enough to put a body in."</p>
            <p>Four hours ago. Just before the messages started. Just before I died digitally.</p>
            <p>"Did you see where she went?" I asked.</p>
            <p>"Saw her get into a taxi at the end of the road." The woman smirked. "Cost a fortune to get a taxi out
                here. Guess her ship finally came in."</p>
            <p>She stepped back into her apartment, preparing to close the door.</p>
            <p>"Watch your back, sweetie," she said, the latch clicking. "That one? She’s got a hole inside her where a
                soul used to be. And she’s hungry."</p>
            <p>The door shut. I was alone in the hallway again.</p>
            <p>She was gone. She was in the wind, wearing my life as a disguise.</p>
            <p>But I had something now. I had a timeline. I had a witness to her transformation. And more importantly, I
                had confirmation of what I had feared most.</p>
            <p>This wasn't about Kyle. It never was. Kyle was just collateral damage, a means to an end.</p>
            <p>I looked at the peeling door of Apartment 3B one last time. I didn't need to go inside. I knew what I
                would find: squalor masked by delusions of grandeur, a shrine to a life she felt entitled to steal.</p>
            <p>I turned and ran back down the stairs, out into the rain, toward the only place she could possibly be
                heading.</p>
            <p>She hadn't gone to Rotterdam to play the grieving friend.</p>
            <p>She was coming to Utrecht. She was coming to my house.</p>
            <p>Because the cuckoo doesn't just steal the nest. It throws the original occupant out.</p>

            <h2>IX.</h2>
            <p>The A2 highway was a river of obsidian, the asphalt drinking the rain as fast as the sky could spill it.
                My speedometer read 150 km/h, the Audi vibrating with a tension that mirrored my own.</p>
            <p>In Tana French’s world, the detective usually drives into the dark knowing they are already too late. In
                Stieg Larsson’s world, the detective drives into the dark to burn it down. Tonight, I was trying to be
                both.</p>
            <p>I forced my mind to compartmentalize. This was a psychological dissociation technique I taught to trauma
                victims: Put the fear in a box. Put the box on a shelf. Look at the room, not the box.</p>
            <p>I looked at the facts. Fact 1: Noa had cloned my phone’s SIM card or accessed my cloud backups. That was
                how she bypassed the two-factor authentication. Fact 2: She had a four-hour head start. Fact 3: She was
                a mimic. A mimic doesn't just want the territory; they want the nest. She wasn't going to rob my
                apartment and leave. She was going to occupy it.</p>
            <p>I exited the highway at Utrecht, the city lights blurring into streaks of sodium orange. My apartment was
                in the Oudegracht district, a renovated canal house with high windows and privacy glass. It was a
                fortress of solitude. Or a tomb, depending on your perspective.</p>
            <p>I didn't park in my designated spot. If Noa was playing the role of Eline, my car would be there. Or she
                would be waiting for me to arrive, to complete the deletion of the original file.</p>
            <p>I parked three streets over, near the Dom Tower. The rain was colder here, carrying the scent of canal
                water and centuries of damp stone. I pulled the collar of the red leather jacket up. It squeaked—a
                sharp, aggressive sound.</p>
            <p>I walked. I kept to the shadows, avoiding the circles of light cast by streetlamps. I wasn't the
                psychologist anymore. I was the anomaly in the system.</p>
            <p>When I turned the corner onto my street, I stopped.</p>
            <p>My apartment was on the second floor. The windows, usually dark at this hour—I preferred low, ambient
                lighting—were blazing. Every light in the place was on. It looked like a stage set.</p>
            <p>I moved closer, pressing myself against the rough brick of the opposing building. I watched.</p>
            <p>A figure passed the window. Ideally, in a thriller, this is where I would tell you I saw a monster. But
                horror is rarely that distinct. Horror is the familiar, distorted by a single degree.</p>
            <p>I saw myself.</p>
            <p>She was wearing my silk robe—the charcoal one I bought in Milan. Her hair was blonde, dyed to the exact
                shade of ash I maintained with expensive salon visits. She moved with my posture: spine straight,
                shoulders back, a glass of wine held loosely in her right hand.</p>
            <p>She was pacing. Not the frantic pacing of a thief, but the thoughtful pacing of an owner. She touched my
                books. She adjusted a sculpture on the mantle. She was calibrating herself to the space.</p>
            <p>My phone, which I had turned back on but kept in airplane mode, vibrated in my pocket. A local alarm
                notification. My smart home system. Front Door Unlocked via App. Heating adjusted to 21°C. Music
                Playing: "Goldberg Variations," J.S. Bach.</p>
            <p>She was playing my playlist. She was drinking my wine. She was wearing my skin.</p>
            <p>I needed a weapon. But I didn't own a gun. I was Dutch; we didn't arm ourselves. We insured ourselves. I
                checked my pockets. Keys. A small canister of pepper spray I kept for late nights at the clinic. And a
                USB drive I used for patient files.</p>
            <p>Think like Salander, I whispered. Stop reacting. Start hacking.</p>
            <p>I didn't need to kick down the door. The house was smart. And smart houses are stupid if you know the
                admin codes. Noa had access to the app, yes. She had logged in as "Eline." But she didn't know the
                hardware. She didn't know that the router in the hallway closet had a physical admin override I had
                installed after a patient threatened to dox me three years ago.</p>
            <p>If I could get within range of the Wi-Fi, I could kill the lights. I could lock the doors. I could turn
                the house against her.</p>
            <p>I crossed the street, keeping low behind the row of parked bicycles. I reached the front door of the
                building. The main entry code hadn't changed—it was a building management code, not mine. I punched it
                in. Click.</p>
            <p>I slipped into the stairwell. It smelled of floor wax and silence. I climbed to the second floor, my
                boots making no sound on the carpeted steps. I stood outside my own door. Inside, I could hear the piano
                music. Bach. Precise, mathematical, cold.</p>
            <p>I pulled out my phone, disabling airplane mode for a split second to connect to the local network. The
                signal was strong. I accessed the router admin panel. User: Admin. Password: [My childhood street name,
                backwards, with the date of my mother's death].</p>
            <p>I was in. I could see the connected devices.</p>
            <p>Eline_iPhone_15 (That was Noa).</p>
            <p>MacBook_Pro (Noa).</p>
            <p>Sonos_LivingRoom (Playing Bach).</p>
            <p>Nest_Thermostat.</p>
            <p>I took a breath. My thumb hovered over the controls. I wasn't going to call the police yet. If I called
                them, she would play the victim. She would show them my ID, my face. She would claim I was the stalker.
                Noa was a liar, but she was a conviction liar. She believed her own fiction, which made her unbeatable
                in an argument.</p>
            <p>No. I had to break the character first.</p>
            <p>I tapped the screen. Action: Lighting > All Zones > Strobe Mode. Action: Sonos > Volume > 100%. Action:
                Sonos > Source > Playlist: "Death Metal" (A joke playlist my brother had made).</p>
            <p>I hit Execute.</p>

            <h2>X.</h2>
            <p>Inside the apartment, the world ended.</p>
            <p>The polite yellow light vanished, replaced by a violent, epileptic flashing of white and dark. The serene
                piano music was annihilated by a wall of distorted guitars and screaming vocals, playing at a volume
                that shook the door frame.</p>
            <p>I heard a scream from inside. Not a scream of fear—a scream of shock. The glass she was holding
                shattered.</p>
            <p>I didn't wait. I keyed the door code and shoved it open.</p>
            <p>The scene inside was a strobe-lit nightmare. Noa was stumbling in the center of the living room, hands
                over her ears, the charcoal robe flapping like the wings of a dying bird. She was disoriented, blinded
                by the flashing lights.</p>
            <p>I stepped in and slammed the door behind me. I didn't turn off the noise. I wanted the chaos. Chaos
                favors the one who created it.</p>
            <p>"TURN IT OFF!" she screamed, her voice cracking. It wasn't my voice anymore. It was hers. The shrill,
                desperate voice of a woman who had lost her daughter.</p>
            <p>I stood by the door, the red jacket catching the strobe lights like fresh blood. "Hello, Noa," I said.
            </p>
            <p>She spun around. For a second, looking at her was like looking into a funhouse mirror. She had the hair,
                the clothes, the posture. But the eyes were wrong. The eyes were terrified.</p>
            <p>She lunged for the coffee table, where my laptop sat open. "I'll delete it!" she shrieked, trying to be
                heard over the death metal. "I'll delete everything! Kyle, the servers, your bank accounts! I have the
                keys!"</p>
            <p>I walked forward. I didn't run. I walked with the slow, terrifying inevitability of a glacier. "Kyle is
                gone, Noa," I shouted over the noise. "You killed a ghost. And my bank accounts? You can have them. You
                want the debt? You want the mortgage? You want the emptiness of this apartment?"</p>
            <p>I reached into my pocket and pulled out the pepper spray. She saw it. She backed up, hitting the
                floor-to-ceiling window. Behind her, the canal was a black void.</p>
            <p>"I am Eline!" she screamed, tears streaming down a face that was painted to look like mine. "I did it
                better than you! I cared about them! You just watched them! You’re a robot! I loved Kyle! I loved the
                group!"</p>
            <p>"You loved the reflection," I said.</p>
            <p>I pulled out my phone with my other hand and cut the music. The silence that slammed into the room was
                heavier than the noise. The lights stopped strobing, settling into a dead, cold white.</p>
            <p>"You aren't Eline," I said, my voice quiet, clinical, deadly. "You are Case File N.Vermeer_12. And we are
                going to finish the session."</p>
            <p>Noa trembled. She looked at the laptop, then at me, then at the window. "I have nothing," she whispered.
                "They took Melody. They took Kyle. If I can't be you... I'm no one."</p>
            <p>"Then be no one," I said. "It’s honest."</p>
            <p>She stared at me. And then, the mimic shifted. The fear vanished, replaced by a cold, digital calculation
                that I recognized from the chat rooms. A smile curled on her lips—not my smile. Kyle’s smile.</p>
            <p>"You think this is physical, Eline?" she said, her voice dropping an octave, imitating the dead man she
                had loved. "I didn't just hack the Wi-Fi. I sent an email five minutes ago. To the medical board. To
                your brother. To the police."</p>
            <p>She tapped her temple.</p>
            <p>"I confessed. As you. I told them about the drugs I stole from the clinic. I told them about how I
                manipulated patients. I destroyed your career, Eline. So even if you kick me out..."</p>
            <p>She spread her arms in the silk robe.</p>
            <p>"...you're just as empty as I am."</p>
            <p>I looked at her. And for the first time in twenty-six years, the ice inside me cracked. I didn't feel
                fear. I felt admiration. She was good. She was truly, horrifyingly good.</p>
            <p>"Good," I said, unzipping the red jacket. "I hated that job anyway."</p>
            <p>I took a step forward. "Now. Get out of my robe."</p>

            <h2>XI.</h2>
            <p>Violence, in reality, is not cinematic. It is clumsy, breathless, and intimate.</p>
            <p>Noa didn't scream. She hissed—a sound of pure, animal panic—and threw the laptop at me. It struck my
                shoulder, a dull thud that I barely felt through the adrenaline. Then she came at me, fingers hooked
                into claws, aiming for the face she had spent months trying to copy.</p>
            <p>We collided in the center of the living room, knocking over a vase of white lilies. The water spilled
                across the hardwood floor, cold and slick. We went down.</p>
            <p>Fighting Noa was like fighting a shadow that had suddenly gained mass. She smelled of my perfume (Santal
                33) and cheap, sour sweat. She was wearing my silk, but her body underneath was wiry and desperate,
                fueled by the manic energy of someone who has burned every bridge behind them.</p>
            <p>She wasn't trying to win. She was trying to erase me. She clawed at my eyes, screaming incoherent curses
                in Dutch, her voice modulating wildly between her own pitch and the deepfake Kyle-voice she had
                weaponized.</p>
            <p>"You don't deserve it! You don't look at them! You don't see them!"</p>
            <p>I pinned her. It wasn't skill; it was weight. I was grounded in this reality; she was untethered. I
                pressed my forearm against her throat, pinning her to the wet floor amidst the scattered lilies.</p>
            <p>"Stop," I said. My voice was a gasp, but it was steady.</p>
            <p>Noa thrashed, her eyes wide, staring up at me. And in that moment, with our faces inches apart, I saw the
                true horror of the algorithm. She didn't hate me. She was disappointed in me. She had stolen my life,
                put it on like a coat, and found it lacking. She had found it cold, lonely, and silent.</p>
            <p>"It’s empty," she choked out, tears mixing with the water on the floor. "Your life... it’s just walls.
                There’s no love here. Even Pia... you just manage her. You don't love her."</p>
            <p>Her words hit harder than her fists.</p>
            <p>"That's why it's mine," I whispered. "I paid for the silence, Noa. You stole it, but you can't afford the
                upkeep."</p>
            <p>I released the pressure on her throat, just enough to let her breathe, but not enough to let her move.
                "Get up," I commanded. "Take off the robe."</p>
            <p>She went limp. The fight drained out of her as quickly as it had arrived. She rolled away, shivering, and
                stood up. She untied the sash. The charcoal silk pooled on the floor like a puddle of ink. Underneath,
                she was wearing cheap thermal leggings and a faded t-shirt—her own skin, finally exposed.</p>
            <p>She looked small. The "Klaudia" persona, the "Eline" persona—they evaporated, leaving only Noa Vermeer, a
                woman who had lost her child and her mind in the glow of a screen.</p>
            <p>"Go," I said. "Before the police get past the lobby door."</p>
            <p>She looked at me one last time. There was no gratitude. Only a lingering, terrifying hunger. "Kyle is
                dead," she said softly. "But the chat... the chat is still there. They need someone, Eline. They always
                need someone."</p>
            <p>She grabbed her bag—a battered canvas thing that looked wrong in my hallway—and ran. I heard the front
                door slam. I heard her footsteps on the stairs, fading into the rhythm of the rain.</p>

            <h2>XII.</h2>
            <p>I didn't chase her. I sat on my sofa, the red leather jacket creaking as I leaned forward, elbows on
                knees. The apartment was silent again, save for the hum of the server in the closet.</p>
            <p>The damage was done. My laptop lay on the floor, screen cracked. The email she had sent—the
                "confession"—was already out there. The medical board. My brother. The police.</p>
            <p>I imagined the notifications lighting up phones across the city. Dr. Eline Vanderberg admits to
                malpractice. Dr. Eline Vanderberg admits to theft.</p>
            <p>I should have been terrified. I should have been on the phone with Lucas, my lawyer brother, formulating
                a defense strategy. I should have been trying to salvage the career I had spent ten years building.</p>
            <p>Instead, I reached for the wine bottle Noa had opened. I poured a glass. I drank.</p>
            <p>It tasted like ash. But as the warmth hit my stomach, I felt a strange, light sensation in my chest. The
                phone rang. It was Lucas. I let it ring. Then the landline rang. I let it ring.</p>
            <p>The silence I had protected so fiercely was gone. But the expectations were gone too. I wasn't the
                prodigy anymore. I wasn't the "good one." I was a scandal. I was a failure.</p>
            <p>And for the first time in my life, I didn't have to be perfect. Noa had burned my reputation to the
                ground, and in doing so, she had burned the cage.</p>

            <h2>XIII.</h2>
            <p>[Six Months Later]</p>
            <p>The café in Berlin was small, smoky, and loud—everything my office in Utrecht wasn't. I wiped the table
                with a napkin and opened my laptop.</p>
            <p>I wasn't a psychologist anymore. I was a consultant for a cybersecurity firm. My "scandal" had made me
                uniquely qualified to talk about identity theft, social engineering, and the psychology of the deepfake.
                I was the expert on the human glitch.</p>
            <p>I didn't use HelloTalk anymore. I didn't use social media. I was a ghost in the machine.</p>
            <p>But sometimes, old habits die hard.</p>
            <p>I opened a secure browser. I routed my IP through three different proxies. I accessed a familiar server
                address. The Room.</p>
            <p>It was still there. The digital space doesn't decay like the real world; it just overwrites. I logged in
                as a guest. No username. Just a listener.</p>
            <p>The voice room was active. I saw familiar names. Bobi_Indo. Julia_Pol.</p>
            <p>Bobi: "So I tell the girl, in Indonesia, if you don't like spicy, you don't like life! Hahaha!" Julia:
                "Bobi, please. You are exhausting."</p>
            <p>They were stuck. Trapped in the loop. The tragedy of Kyle, the disappearance of Pia (who was now living
                in a commune in Portugal, according to the last rumors), the scandal of Eline—it was all just lore now.
                Content to be consumed and forgotten.</p>
            <p>And then, a new user icon lit up. User: Melody_60s Avatar: A black and white photo of a 1960s singer.</p>
            <p>My breath caught. Melody. The name of Noa’s daughter.</p>
            <p>Melody_60s: "Hello everyone. I am new here. I love classical music and vintage fashion. Does anyone want
                to practice Dutch?"</p>
            <p>Her voice came through the speakers. It wasn't Noa’s voice. It was lighter, younger, hesitant. But the
                cadence... the pause before the question... the desperate need for approval.</p>
            <p>Bobi: "Hello Melody! Welcome! Where are you from?" Melody_60s: "I am from... everywhere. I am looking for
                friends."</p>
            <p>I stared at the screen. Was it her? Had she reinvented herself again, using the name of the child she had
                lost? Or was it someone else, another lonely soul about to be fed into the grinder?</p>
            <p>It didn't matter. The algorithm didn't care who the users were. It only cared that they were engaged. It
                only cared that they were envious, hungry, and alone.</p>
            <p>I moved my cursor to the "Exit" button. But before I clicked, I saw one more message pop up in the text
                chat.</p>
            <p>Melody_60s: Does anyone know a good psychologist? I feel like I'm born in the wrong era.</p>
            <p>I froze. I looked at the text. I looked at the rain streaking the window of the Berlin café. I typed.</p>
            <p>Guest: Run.</p>
            <p>I hit enter. And then I closed the laptop, leaving them to the ghosts.</p>
